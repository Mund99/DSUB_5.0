     two cruel green orbs set in a wide grey face                       142      down the near side of the trunk was a deep and wide new scar       172      ‘and to think it was this here little red

                                        208      the dog bounded high  but i was safely out of his reach            224     the life story of a squirrel     chapter i  my first adventure   it was a perfect june morning  not a breath stirring  and the sun fairly baking down till the whole air was full of the hot resinous scent of pine needles  but  warm as it was  i was shivering as i lay out on the tip of a larch bough and looked down  i was not giddy—a squirrel never is  but that next bough below me  where my mother was sitting  seemed very far away  and i could not help thinking what a tremendous fall it would be to the ground  supposing i happened to miss my landing place  i am too old now to blush at the recollection of it  and i don t mind confessing that at the time i was in what i have since heard called a blue funk   the fact is  it was my first jumping and climbing lesson  even squirrels have to learn to climb  just as birds have to be taught by their parents to fly   my mother called me by my name  scud  sitting up straight  and looking at me encouragingly with her pretty black eyes  but i still hesitated  crouching low on my branch and clinging tight to it with all four sets of small sharp claws   mother grew a trifle impatient  and called to my brother rusty to take my place   this was too much for me  i took my courage in both fore paws  set my teeth  and launched myself desperately into the air  i came down flat on my little white stomach  but as at that time i weighed rather less than four ounces  and the bough below was soft and springy  i did not knock the wind out of myself  as one of you humans would have done if you had fallen in the same way   mother gave a little snort  she did not approve of my methods  and told me i should spread my legs wider and make more use of my tail  then she turned and gave a low call to rusty to follow   even at that early age—we were barely a month old—rusty was a heavier and rather slower going squirrel than i  but he already showed that bull dog courage which was so strong a trait all through his after life  he crawled deliberately to the very end of the branch  then simply let go and tumbled all in a heap right on the top of us  it was extremely lucky for him that mother was so quick as she was  she made a rapid bound forward  and caught her blundering son by the loose skin at the back of his neck just in time to save him from going headlong to the ground  quite fifty feet below   she panted with fright as she lifted him to a place of safety with a little shake   rusty looked a trifle sulky  and mother gave him an affectionate pat to soothe him down   then she told us to follow her back along the branch  and she would show us how to climb up the trunk home again  she sent me first   i had hardly reached the trunk end of the bough when i heard mother utter a cry which i had never heard her give before  it was a low sharp call  oddly enough  i seemed to know exactly what it meant  at once i lay flat upon the bough  here quite thick enough to hide my small body  and crouched down  making myself as small as possible  at the same instant mother seized rusty by the scruff of his neck  and with one splendid leap sprang right up on to the wide  thick bough on the flat surface of which our home was built  in a few seconds she came back for me  and before i knew what was the matter i  too  was safe in the nest  alongside rusty and my sister  little hazel   mother gave a low note of warning that none of us should move or make any noise  and you may be sure we all obeyed  for something in her manner frightened us greatly  presently we heard heavy footfalls down below rustling in the dry pine needles  we sat closer than ever  hardly daring to breathe  the footsteps stopped just below our tree  and a loud rough voice  that made every nerve in my body quiver  shouted out something  from the sound of it we could tell that the speaker was peering right up between the boughs into our tree  and we knew without the slightest doubt he had discovered our drey  he must have spoken loud  even for a human  for his companion gave a sharp ‘s s sh   as if he were afraid that some one else might overhear and come down upon them  it could not have been of us he was afraid  for we  poor trembling  palpitating little things  lay huddled together  hardly daring to breathe   the two tormentors turned away a few paces after a few lower toned remarks  and i began to think they had gone  when——  crash  a great jagged lump of stone came hurtling up within a yard of our home  frightening us all abominably   mother crouched with us closer than ever into our frail little house of sticks  which was not made to stand the force of stones   almost immediately there fell another mass of whizzing stone  even nearer than the first  it shore away a large tassel from the bough just overhead  and this fell right on the top of us  frightening hazel so much that she jumped completely out of the nest  and  if mother had not been after her as quick as lightning  she must have fallen over the edge and probably tumbled right down to the ground and been killed at once  even a squirrel  particularly a young one  cannot fall fifty feet in safety   mother saved her from this fate  but the mischief was done  the quick eyes of our enemies below had caught a glimpse of red fur among the pale green foliage  and they roared out in triumph  the louder and noisier making such a row  i thought that anyone within hearing must come rushing to see what was the matter  then they began disputing together  perhaps as to which of them should carry us away   we lay there nestling under mother s thick fur  shaking with fright   the two fellows down below argued like angry magpies for several minutes  and at last it was decided that the quieter one should do the climbing  i peeped over timidly and saw him throw off his coat  and drew back to make myself as small as possible  presently i heard a bough creak  and then there followed a scraping and grinding as his heavy hobnailed boots clawed the trunk in an effort to reach the first branch  once on that  he came up with dreadful rapidity  the boughs of the larch were so close together that even such a great clumsy animal  with his hind paws all covered up with leather and iron  could climb it as easily as a ladder  we heard him coughing and making queer noises as the thick green dust  which always covers an old larch  got into his throat  and the little sharp dry twigs switched his face  but he kept on steadily  and soon he was only three or four branches below us  and making the whole top of the tree quiver and shake with his clumsy struggles  but as he got higher the branches were thinner  and he stopped  evidently not daring to trust his weight to them  and called out something to his companion  all the answer he got was a jeering laugh  and this probably decided him  for  with a growl  he came on again  the tree really was thin up near our bough  at least for a great giant like this  the trunk itself bent  and the shaking was so tremendous that i began to think that our whole home would be jerked loose from its platform and go tumbling down in ruins with us inside it   suddenly the fellow s great rough head was pushed up through the branches just below  his fat cheeks were crimson  and his hair all plastered down on his forehead with perspiration  i stared at him in a sort of horrible fascination  i could not have moved for the life of me  and  as rusty and hazel told me afterwards  they felt just the same  but mother kept her head  she was sitting up straight  with her bright black eyes fairly snapping with rage and excitement   the man made a desperate scramble  and up came a large dirty paw and grasped the very branch on which we lived  this was too much for mother  her fur fairly bristled as she made a sudden dash out of the nest by the entrance nearest to the trunk  and went straight for that grasping fist  next instant her sharp teeth met deep in his first finger  he gave one yell and let go  all his weight came on his other hand  there was a loud snap  and his large red face disappeared with startling suddenness   for a moment our tree felt just as it does when a strong gust of wind catches and sways it  our enemy  luckily for himself  had fallen upon a wide spreading bough not far below  had caught hold of it  and so saved himself from a tumble right down to the bottom   i heard his companion cry out in a frightened voice  for a moment there was no reply  and then a torrent of language so angry that i am sure no respectable squirrel would have used anything so bad even when talking to a weasel   the man who had fallen was dancing about  holding his hand in his mouth  and taking it out to show his comrade  i watched him excitedly  hoping that now he had been hurt he would go away  but no  picking himself up he began again clumsily climbing up towards us  he came more slowly than before  trying each branch carefully before he put his weight on it  presently i saw his furious face rising up again through the branches  and now he had something shining and sharp  like a long tooth  clutched between his lips  i did not know then what a knife was  but i thought it looked particularly unpleasant  there was a nasty shine  too  in his pale blue eyes  i could feel my heart throbbing as if it would burst  again his great ugly paw came clutching up at our bough  fortunately he could not quite reach it  having broken off the branch just below us  he had nothing to hold on to  however  he was so angry that there was no stopping him  he got his arms and legs round the trunk and began to swarm up   it looked as if nothing could save us now  mother herself was too frightened of that long gleaming tooth to try to bite our enemy again  she jumped out of the nest by the entrance on the far side  and did her best to persuade us to follow her out to the end of the branch where we had been having our jumping lessons  but we were much too frightened to move  we lay shivering in the moss at the bottom of the nest  and made ourselves as small as we knew how   the man s head was level with the bough  he was stretching out for a good hand hold  when suddenly i heard the sharp clatter of a blackbird from the hedge at the border of the spinny  and immediately afterwards the crash of dry twigs under a heavy boot   a sharp hiss came from below in warning  bill s hand stopped in mid air  just as i once saw a rabbit stop at the moment the shot struck it  his cheeks  which had been almost as red as my tail  went the colour of a sheep s fleece  he listened for a moment  then suddenly dropped to the bough below  and began clambering down a good deal more quickly than he had come up   we guessed it was the keeper  who had always left us alone  though we had often seen him about   the steady tramp of his boots suddenly changed to a quick thud  thud  and when he saw the fellows at the tree  he gave a deep roar  just like the bull that lives in the meadow by the river when he gets angry  he came running along at a tremendous pace  making such a tramping among the leaves and pine needles that the blackbird  though she had flown far away  started up again with a louder scream than ever   the man on the ground did not wait  deserting his companion  he made off at top speed  but old crump  the keeper  knew better than to waste his time in catching him  he had seen the boughs shaking and he came straight for our tree  and shouted triumphantly as he caught sight of the other one  who was by this time only a few boughs from the ground   in his hurry and fright the fellow missed his hold  next moment there was a tremendous thump  and a worse row even than when he had taken his first tumble   i peeped out of the nest again more confidently  and i thought they were fighting  but what had happened was that the poacher had fallen right on the top of crump s head  flooring him completely  and  i should think  knocking all the breath out of him  then  before the keeper  who was as fat as a dormouse  could gain his feet  the other had picked himself up and gone off full tilt after his friend   the keeper growled and muttered to himself as he rose slowly  he picked up his gun and walked round the tree  looking up  evidently puzzled as to what the men had been after  then he caught sight of us  and shook his head  as if he would have much liked to capture us himself he certainly could not have had any friendly feeling for us  as we bit the tips off his young larches  but he must have had orders to let us alone  for he did not attempt to molest us  and presently  to our great relief  he too stumped off and left us undisturbed   we lay very still for a long time  slowly getting over our fright  suddenly mother gave a pleased little squeak and jumped out of the nest  i crawled out too  as boldly as you please  and looked down  here came father running along over the thick brown carpet of pine needles which covered the ground  i know some of you humans laugh at a squirrel on the ground  but it is not our fault that we do not look so well there as in our proper place—a tree  why  even the swan  supposed to be the most graceful thing in the world  waddles in the clumsiest fashion imaginable when it is on dry land  at any rate  even over flat ground a squirrel can move at a good pace   father was lopping along with his fore paws very wide apart  and stopping now and then to sniff or burrow a little among the pine and larch needles  in one place he evidently found something good—possibly a nice fat grub—for he stopped  sat up on his hind legs  and  holding whatever it was in his fore paws  began to nibble at it daintily  how handsome he looked sitting there  with his beautiful sharp ears cocked  his splendid brush hoisted straight up  and the rich  ruddy fur of his back just touched by a stray gleam of sunshine  contrasting beautifully with the snowy whiteness of his waistcoat  it has always been my opinion that he was the handsomest squirrel i ever saw  and i was never more pleased in my life than when mother once told me that she thought i was more like him than any of her other children   mother called again  father looked up  caught sight of her  gave a quick flick of his tail and an answering call  next instant we heard the rattle of his claws on the rough bark  and almost before i could look round here he was with us   he was full of good humour  for he had been over to the beech copse  and the mast  he told us  was the finest crop he had seen for years  we must collect a good store as soon as it got ripe   but he suddenly noticed that mother was quivering all over  and he had not time to ask what had upset her before she burst into an account of all the dreadful things that had happened that morning   then he looked very grave   ‘we must go   he said  ‘it means building a new house  and this tree has suited us so admirably  i do not think that i have ever seen a weasel near it  then  too  we are so capitally sheltered from bad weather by all these thick evergreens  in any case i shall not leave the plantation  but i suppose we must look out for another tree  we cannot do anything to day  it is too late  now i will mount guard over the youngsters while you go and get some dinner    and rather uneasily she went off   the heat of the day was over  but the sun was still warm  a little breeze was talking gently up in the murmurous tops of the trees  causing the shadows to sway and dance in dappled lights on the lower branches  you humans  who never go anywhere without stamping  and running  and talking loudly  and lighting pipes with crackly matches  have no idea what the real life of the woods is like  especially on a fine june afternoon such as this one was  though our larch was one of a thick clump  yet from the great height of our nest we could see right across into the belt of oaks  beeches  and old thorn trees which lay along the slope below  and could even catch a glimpse of the tall hedge and bank  and of the sandy turf beyond where the rabbit warren lay   one by one the rabbits lopped silently out of their burrows and began to feed till the close turf was almost as brown as green  stupid fellows  rabbits  i always think  but i like to watch them  especially when the young ones play  jumping over and over one another  or when some old buck  with a sudden idea that a fox or weasel is on the prowl  whacks the ground with one hind leg  and then all scuttle helter skelter back into their holes   a pompous old cock pheasant came strutting down a ride in the young bracken  the sun shining full on his glossy plumage and black barred tail  presently his wife followed him  and behind her came a dozen chicks flitting noiselessly over the ground like so many small brown shadows  a pair of wood pigeons were raising their second brood in a fir tree  not far away from where we lived  and every now and then  with a rapid clatter of wings  one of the old birds came flapping through the aisles of the plantation with food for their two ugly  half fledged young ones  i wonder  by the by  why a wood pigeon is so amazingly careless about its nest building  i never can understand how it is that the young ones do not fall off the rough platform of sticks which is their apology for a nest  and it must be shockingly cold and draughty  too  birds are supposed to be ahead of all other nest builders  but i can tell you there are a good many besides the wood pigeon who might take a few pointers in architecture from us squirrels  to say nothing of our distant cousin the door mouse   a sharp rat a tat just behind startled me  and there was a big green woodpecker hanging on tight against the trunk of our own larch with his strong claws  and pounding the bark with his hammer like beak  father looked at him with interest   ‘ah   he observed  ‘it s about time we did move  the old tree must be getting rotten  or we shouldn t have a visit from him    it was all most pleasant and peaceful as we sat there—rusty  hazel  and i—enjoying the gentle swinging in the soft west wind  and waiting for mother to come home   it was a very fine summer  that one  i have never seen one like it since  we had very little rain and no storms for weeks on end  and the crops of mast and nuts were splendid   but i am running ahead too fast  the very next day after our narrow escape from the two loafers  father set to work to make a new house in the fir tree he had spoken of  luckily for him  there was an old carrion crow s nest handy in the top branches  and he got plenty of sticks out of this for the framework  mother helped him to gather some moss—nice dry stuff from the roots of a beech  and he made a tidy job of it within three days  of course  he did not build so elaborately as if he had been constructing a winter nest—we squirrels never do  but all the same  he put a good water tight roof over it   meantime mother had been keeping us youngsters hard at work with our climbing and jumping lessons  we all got on very well  and the day before we were to move she actually let me come down to the ground  it was the funniest feeling coming down so low  and at first i cannot say that i liked it  there was no spring in the earth  and one did not seem able to get a good hold for one s claws  the pine needles slipped away when one tried to jump  however  after the first novelty wore off  i enjoyed the new sensation hugely  and my joy was complete when mother showed me a little fat brown beetle which she said i might eat  i tried it  and really it might have been a nut  it was so crisp and plump   rusty and hazel were sitting on a bough overhead  and as full of envy as ever they could be  for mother had said that she really could not have more than one of us at a time down among the dangers of the ground  and that i was the only one quick enough to look after myself if anything happened   my quickness was fated to be tested  while mother was scratching about the tree roots  having a hunt for any stray nuts of last autumn s store that might hitherto have been overlooked  i moved off to see if i could not discover another of those tasty beetles  at a little distance lay a great log  the slowly rotting remains of a tall tree that had been torn up by the roots in some winter gale many years before  and was now half buried in the ground  on its far side was a perfect thicket of bracken  and a great bramble grew in the hollow where the roots of the tree had once been  and hid the fast decaying trunk  there was a curious earthy smell about the place which somehow attracted me  i know now that it was from a sort of fungus which grows in the rotten wood  and is quite good to eat  but at that time i was still too young to understand this  however  i went gaily grubbing about  and at last ventured on the very top of the log and pattered down it towards the trunk end  near the butt was a hollow in the worm eaten wood  the bramble was thick on all sides  but there was an opening above through which a patch of bright sunlight leaked down  in the middle of this dry  warm cavity was a small coil of something of almost the same colour as the wood on which it lay  at first i took it for a twisted stick  but it attracted me strangely  and i gradually moved nearer  it was not until i came to the very edge of the hollow and sat up on my hind legs that i suddenly became aware that the odd coil had a little diamond shaped head  in which were set two beady eyes  there was a horrible cold  cruel look in those unwinking eyes which had a strange effect upon me  i turned cold and stiff  and felt as if  for the very life of me  i could not move  suddenly a forked tongue flickered out  the dead coil took life  i saw the muscles ripple below the ashen skin  it was that movement which saved me  as the horrid head flashed forward  i leaped high into the air  the narrow head and two thin  keen fangs gleaming white passed less than my own length below me  and i fell into the thick of the bramble  the worst scared squirrel in the wood  how i scrambled out i have no idea  but in another instant i was scuttling back to my mother  full of my direful tale   when i told her what had happened she looked very grave   ‘it was an adder   she said  shivering  ‘if it had bitten you  you would have been dead before sunset  keep close to me  scud    the next day we moved into our new quarters in the fir tree  personally  i never liked a fir so well as most other trees  it is so dark and gloomy  and you get so little sun  my own preference has always been for a beech  an old beech has such delightful nooks and crannies  and often deep holes  sometimes deep and large enough to build a winter home in—always capital for the storage of nuts  there was no doubt  however  that the fir which father had chosen had many points to recommend it  it was an immensely tall tree  and thick as a hedge  yet there were no branches close to the ground to tempt evil minded young humans like our recent invaders to climb up  what was still better  so cunningly had father chosen his site that it was quite impossible for any evil minded  two legged creatures to see us from below  our nest was founded on a large  flat topped branch close in to the thick red trunk  and only about two thirds of the way up to the top  another branch almost equally thick formed a roof over our heads  so that we were very snug and comfortable      chapter ii  the great disaster   the day on which the great disaster befell us was wet in the early morning  and when the sun rose a thick  soft mist  white like cotton wool  hung over the country side  not a breath of air was stirring  and it was so intensely still that it seemed as though one could hear everything that moved from one end of the wood to the other  the plop of a water rat diving into a pool in the stream on the far side of the coppice came as clearly to my ears as though the water had been at the bottom of our own tree instead of several hundred yards away  and when the wood pigeons began to move unseen in the smother  the clatter of their wings was positively startling   we squirrel folk are not fond of wet  so we lay still and snug in our cosy retreat until the sun began to eat up the mist  soon the grey smother thinned and sank  leaving the tree tops bathed in brilliant light  every twig dripping with moisture  and every drop sparkling with intense brilliance  then we crept out one by one  and  sitting up straight upon our haunches  began our morning toilet  no other woodland creature is so careful and tidy in its habits as a squirrel  and mother had already thoroughly instructed us in the proper methods of using our paws as brushes and our tongues as sponges  and in making ourselves neat and smart as self respecting  healthy squirrels should be   suddenly a peal of distant bells came clanging through the moist  calm air with such a vibrating note that they made us all start  father sat up sharply  and mother asked him what was the matter   he explained to us that he had learnt by experience that when those bells rang out it was a dangerous time for us  for all the mischievous boys and rough fellows in the neighbourhood seemed to appear in the woods  and the keeper was never seen  he did not know why this should be  but from long custom he had grown to be uneasy at the sound   mother shuddered sympathetically  and rubbed against him caressingly  with a movement that told him not to worry  and she reminded him consolingly that even if our tormentors did take it into their heads to come into the wood they would not be likely to find us  since we had moved   but father  instead of responding  suddenly pricked up his ears  and  signalling to us to be quiet  listened eagerly to some sound which the rest of us had not yet caught  for a moment he sat up straight  as still as though stuffed  then he turned and spoke sharply  with a warning sound that told us to lie as still as mice  for some danger was approaching   sure enough  a minute later we all heard the warning cry of a frightened blackbird  and immediately afterwards the brushing and trampling of a number of heavy boots through the wet grass and fern in the distance  at once we all stretched ourselves out tight as bark along the flat bough which formed the foundation of our nest  and lay there still as so many sleeping dormice   the steps came rapidly nearer  and soon voices sounded plainly through the hush of the quiet wood  imagine how i shuddered when i recognized the coarse tones of our former enemies mixed with others equally harsh and unpleasant  they were making straight for our part of the wood   shaking though i was in every limb  curiosity drove me to peep cautiously over the edge of the bough  the mist was all gone now  and there  below the tall larch tree which had been our old home and the scene of our recent narrow escape  stood four young louts  our old enemies and two others about the same size and age  all craning their necks and staring upwards through the thick  pale green branches  each was carrying in his right hand a short  flexible stick with a heavy head  these were not long enough for walking sticks  such as crump  the keeper  and other humans who sometimes came through the wood carried  and  in spite of my fright  i wondered greatly what they were for  alas  it was not long before i learnt the terrible powers of the cruel ‘squailer    after a good deal of argument and dispute one of the new comers swung himself up on to the lowest bough  he climbed far better and faster than the one who had tried before  and in a very short time had reached a bough close below our old drey   by this time i was getting over my fright a little  i turned to rusty  who was next me   ‘what a sell for them when they find no one at home   i whispered in his ear   but rusty only grunted  and a sharp signal for silence came from father   the bough which had been broken before stopped the climber for a few moments  but presently he managed to swarm up the trunk and seat himself astride of the very branch upon which our former home was founded   they shouted to him from below to be careful  the fellow in the tree paid no heed  but  clutching the trunk with one hand to steady himself  boldly thrust the other into the nest  there was a sharp exclamation of disgust  and he cried out furiously that there was nothing there   they were all in great excitement  and kept urging him to look further and to make sure we weren t hiding  he felt in every crevice of the nest  and peered about in the boughs  and then  having evidently made up his mind we had really gone  prepared to descend   but the others called to him to look again  so  steadying himself once more upon the bough  he peered upward  then he solemnly declared  shaking his head  that there was nothing in the tree  to prove it  with a sweep of his great red paw  he carelessly ripped our old home from its perch and sent it tumbling to the ground  i heard mother give a little gasp as she saw destroyed in an instant the results of so many hours of careful and loving toil  but my own thoughts and eyes were so concentrated upon the invader of our rightful domain that i am afraid i hardly considered her injured feelings  still they would not allow him to come down  and now came in a very real danger  from the ground it would have been quite impossible for them to spy us out in our new quarters  but up the tree this fellow was on a level with us  and had only to get a clear look between the boughs to spy our little red bodies  which  however much we crouched together  made a considerable ball of fur   climbing to his feet  he stood upright on the bough  clinging with one arm to the trunk  it was this movement which proved our undoing  standing thus  his head was clear of the dwindling foliage near the spire like summit of the larch  and from his lofty perch his eye commanded the tree tops in the neighbourhood  a moment later his gaze fell upon us  five small scared balls of red fur  and his roar of triumph struck terror to our quaking hearts   without paying the slightest attention to the shouted questions of his friends below  he swung himself down hand over hand  and in a very short time had dropped to the ground  and was running across towards our fir tree  with the others yelping at his heels like a pack of harriers after a hare   mother and father exchanged a few hurried words  but what they said i in my excitement had not the faintest idea  next moment father had me by the scruff of the neck  and darted away up into the thick and almost impenetrable top of the giant fir  mother  with hazel between her teeth  came after him like a flash   the fir trunk forked near the summit  it was to this point that father carried me  and dropped me in the niche between the two boughs  instantly he was off again to fetch rusty  before our enemies had noticed what was happening  and while they were still arguing as to which of them should do the climbing  all we three youngsters had been deposited together in our lofty refuge   a scuffling noise and the sound of heavy breathing came from below  one of the gang had begun the ascent of the tree  mother looked at father in a sort of dumb agony  she was palpitating with fright  and her dark eyes were large and brilliant with terror   ‘can we reach another tree  redskin   she asked tremblingly   but father knew better  and signified  ‘no   they two might have done it themselves  but carrying us the jump would be too long to risk   from far below the bumping  scuffling noise slowly grew louder and nearer  it was a long way up to the first bough of the fir tree  and the climber—it was the same one again—was obliged to swarm the scaly red trunk  we could not  of course  see anything of him  for the matted tangle of crooked branches below  with their foliage of thick  dark green needles  formed an impenetrable screen   i cannot even now remember that long wait in the sunny tree top  while ever from below the unseen danger crept upon us  without an unpleasant thrill  and i know that both my brother and my sister shared my feelings  the worst part of it all was the sight of the terror of our father  who had always been to us a pattern of bravery  the fact was that he realized the position  which we younger ones did not do fully  he was only too well aware that we were trapped  he and mother might have easily escaped by descending to the longer branches below  and thence jumping into a spruce which grew close by  but they would not desert us  and both remained clinging tightly to the main trunk just beside us   the hollow in which my brother and sister and i were placed gave us complete shelter from below  but there was only just room for the three of us  father and mother were forced to expose themselves  the fir was  as i have said before  a very large tree—quite seventy feet high—old  thick  and gnarled  and the boughs were of considerable thickness near to its very summit  father no doubt understood that our bulky enemy would  if he had the pluck  be able to pursue us right up to our lofty perch  and was aware of our almost hopeless position   slowly  very slowly  our persecutor came upwards  the branches  once he was among them  were so close and thick that he evidently found it difficult to force his way between them  every now and then he would stop and puff and blow  then the creaking of large boughs and the cracking of small twigs announced a fresh effort on his part   at last he was only separated from our second nest by a very small interval  yet he had not discovered it was empty  the others kept yelling out questions to him  but he made no reply  only forced his way through the tree  which  i am bound to say  was very thick indeed   more scrambling  then he caught sight of the nest and redoubled his efforts  but when he was nearly up to it he reached up his arm  and without the slightest fear that he might be bitten as his companion had been  thrust his huge hand into it  the result was a savage exclamation  angrily he seized the empty nest  tore it out  and sent it flying down as he had done the other   by this time the others were a little tired of waiting  and began to scatter out from the tree to try to spy us themselves  common sense must have told them that we had only left the nest when we heard them  and could not be far  and that we could probably be seen somewhere in the surrounding boughs  a few moments  suspense  and then the awful warning shout again told us we were discovered  the man was still in the tree  though some way below  and by pointing and gesticulations they directed him where to go to find us  so he came panting up again  the thinner branches swaying and rustling beneath his weight  after a very few moments his head appeared in the greenery below  he was of a different type from the others  taller  black haired  and sallow faced  it did not take him many seconds to see us  and he quickly pulled himself up towards us   with his eyes fixed on mother  he came rapidly upwards  mother crouched where she was on a small branch  very close to the extreme summit of the tree  watching our enemy s every movement  by a lucky chance the main stem hid us three youngsters from his sight  i think that father and mother must have purposely placed themselves on the other side from us with the express object of drawing the boy s attention away from their helpless babies   when he drew near he paused  and pulling a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket  deliberately wrapped it round one hand  then  getting a good grip with the other  he edged outwards and made a sudden rapid grasp at mother  my heart almost stopped as i saw the great hand extended  but quick as he was  no human can hope to rival the lightning action of a squirrel s muscles  and before the grasping hand touched her the little lithe red body flew into the air as though driven by a spring  and  flashing downwards  landed fully twenty feet below  and disappeared into the thickest part of the tree   with a violent exclamation the tormentor turned his attention to father  who was only a foot or two further away  and crouching on the extreme outer end of a bough  evidently he intended to make sure of him  for he worked himself round so as to get between father and the tree  and managed it so well that he seemed to me to have cut off all chance of escape  i think he must have actually touched father s tail  when the most unexpected thing happened  instead of jumping outwards  which  as the bough tip projected a good way  would in all probability have ended in a fall to the ground  into the very hands of the three watchers below  father leaped straight towards the boy  landing actually on his shoulder  this startled him so much that he very nearly let go altogether  and if i had not been in such a panic i could have laughed at his fright  then  before the boy could recover himself  another quick bound  and father was out on another branch  ten feet away  quite out of reach of his would be captor    illustration  father leaped straight towards the boy landing actually on his shoulder   a torrent of language worse than any magpie s burst from the fellow s lips  as he turned and scrambled after father again  he might as well have tried to catch a will o  the wisp  every time he got near enough to make a snatch  father would make another nimble jump  all the time artfully luring his pursuer lower down the tree and away from our hiding place   the game went on for a good ten minutes  and by the end of that time the enemy was dripping with perspiration and speechless with fury  his rage was increased by the jeers of his friends below  at last he gave it up  having made up his mind it was not much of a game to be made a fool of by a squirrel and mocked by the onlookers   he dropped quickly from bough to bough  and presently i heard his heavy boots thud on the ground  but before he had reached the foot of the tree  both our parents were back with us  then the sound of loud wrangling came up to us  surely now they would go  but no  we were not safe yet   there was further talk  and then the whole four spread out in a circle round the fir tree  presently  with a loud whizzing sound  some heavy object came hurtling up past us  it struck a twig near the summit of the tree and clipped it like a bullet  thud  another struck the main stem just below us with a force that sent the bark flying in a shower  then we saw what those lead weighted canes were for   a third squailer passed only a few inches above father s head  he called to mother   ‘they ll kill us if we stop here  come along  take hazel and follow me    in an instant he had snatched me up and was scuttling down the trunk  it was wonderful how exactly he knew which branch end stretched furthest towards the spruce which was our next neighbour  out along it he ran  and using the natural spring of the bough to help him  made a gallant leap outwards and downwards  legs and tail wide spread to assist him in his flight   the air hissed past my ears  and then with a little thud we landed safely in the spruce  but his gallant jump had been seen by those greedy eyes  and excited shouts came from below   then—ah  even now i can hardly bear to speak of it  as father was in the very act of running up the branch towards the thick centre of the tree and comparative safety  there came a cruel thud  and he and i together were whirling through the air   crash  we came to the ground with a shock that knocked my small senses out of me  and before i could pick myself up a hard hand had closed over me  i turned and  with the instinct of despair  fixed my teeth deep in a horny finger  there was a yell  and i was again flung to the ground with a force that almost killed me  i knew no more for many minutes  and when i woke again to stunned and aching misery  i was lying helpless in a sort of bag  which smelt horribly of something which i now know to have been tobacco  the bag was being shaken up and down with a steady swing  but i  almost beside myself with pain and flight  did not attempt to move or free myself   suddenly the motion stopped abruptly  and the hand was poked cautiously into the bag  it was carefully protected this time by a handkerchief  but i had no longer spirit left to bite  out i was pulled and held up before the gaze of all the four robbers  who were seated at ease on a mossy bank on the outer side of the hedge close by the gate of our coppice  the very first thing that my eyes fell upon was the body of my poor father lying limp upon the bank  his white waistcoat dabbled with crimson stains and his brilliant black eyes closed in death  i felt a cold shiver run through me  and the stupor of despair clutched my beating heart  i hardly even had strength left to wonder what had become of my dear mother and my brother and sister   they passed me from one coarse hot hand to another  and their voices grew louder and louder as they disputed who should have possession of me   they then went on to blows  when suddenly the quarrel was brought to an abrupt end in a most startling fashion   leaping over the hedge out of the coppice behind came two tall  smart looking boys  a startling contrast to the four loutish hobbledehoys around poor little me   one of them  pointing at me  demanded in a ringing voice where they had got me from   three of the four cads stood sheepishly regarding the new comers  and said never a word  but the one who had climbed the tree faced them boldly enough  answering impudently   the new comer strode up to him  he was evidently master here  and the others were trespassing  and they knew it  for they slunk back  yet  in reply to his reiterated commands  the lout who was boldest snatched me up and refused to part with me  he was so big and strong that he seemed a giant  and i felt i should die there and then  i closed my eyes and gave myself up  but in a minute i was down on the bank once more  and the two—the new comer and the great rough fellow—were fighting hard  with coats off and red faces   the sound of the blows that followed  the tramping of feet  the hard breathing of the combatants  nearly deprived me of the few senses that remained to me  and i noticed little of the details of the fight—only it seemed to last a long time  and once i saw the schoolboy flat on his back  but he was up almost as soon as down  and they were at it again hammer and tongs   the giant made a rush head down  like a bull  but the other jumped back  and there followed a rattle of blows as my champion s fists got home on the lout s hard head  but the squire s son did not wholly escape  the huge fist that had grasped me so roughly caught him on the right cheek and drove him back   one of my champion s eyes was closing  his right cheek was turning livid  and there was blood on his broad white collar when they faced one another again  but the ruffian for his part  though not so badly marked  was breathing like a fat pug dog and seemed unsteady on his legs  to do the fellow justice  he had pluck  for he wasted no time in making a last attempt to rush his opponent  for a few moments it was all that the other could do to guard his head against the swinging fists  then—it was all so quick that one could hardly see what happened—there was a crack like the sound two rams make when they charge one another  and the giant tottered for a moment  his arms waving wildly  then fell like a log and lay quite still   the other new comer counted loud and slowly ‘one—two—three—four —up to ten  but the fellow on the ground did not move   ‘that s the finish   he said   he turned to where i lay  with hardly a breath in me  a little limp body  and picking me up  handled me tenderly   terrified as i was  the change was grateful to my miserable  aching little body  he offered me to the victor in the fight  who had by this time got into his coat again  but he declined   ‘put him in your pocket  harry   he said to his brother  ‘my hands are too hot to hold him    he was quite right  let me here give a word of advice to all those humans who keep any of my race as pets  don t hold us in your hands  in the first place  it frightens us desperately  and in the second  it is bad for us  a squirrel rarely lives long in captivity if he is constantly handled  i speak from experience  and i can assure you that  much as i grew to love my dear master and my other human friends  i was never happy in their hands  though i never minded being kept in their pockets   harry put me carefully in the inside pocket of his jacket  it was dark and warm  and  utterly exhausted  i curled up and lay quiet  and so i was carried away and left the home of my babyhood  it was long before i saw it again      chapter iii  the pleasures of imprisonment   i was aroused from a sort of stupor between sleep and exhaustion by being picked out of my snug retreat and held up for inspection before a third person  a sweet faced lady  whom i afterwards came to know well and love as the mother of my dear master  jack fortescue  and his brother harry   she looked at me pitifully when her son had quickly explained the events of the morning  her fingers were long and slim and cool  and  poor limp little rag that i was  i never offered the slightest resistance to her gentle grasp  she took me straight through a side door into a long  low  shady building with wood lined walls  and in a minute or two i was placed in a nest of soft hay in a good sized box covered in front with close wire netting  too worn out to trouble my head about the amazing and perplexing change in my circumstances  i simply curled up with my tail over my nose and went sound asleep   it was jack who woke me  i must have been asleep for a long time  for now the sun was pouring in through the western windows  the first thing i realized was that i was desperately hungry  and that the little saucer which the boy had pushed gently into the cage had a most appetizing odour  but my sleep had given me fresh life and strength  and quiet as his movements were  i remember that i was desperately frightened  and cowered down  shivering  burrowing close in the hay   jack seemed to understand perfectly  for he closed the door again very softly and moved away  presently the silence restored my confidence a little  and i ventured to peep out  the saucer was quite close to my nose  and  hunger overpowering my fright  i crawled up and tasted the mixture  it was bread and milk  soft and well cooked  i finished it very rapidly  and then  feeling much refreshed  went to sleep for a second time   once again before dark jack came and fed me  and this time brought me a couple of ready cracked nuts  as well as the bread and milk   well fed and cared for as i was  i shall never forget the misery of that first night  i don t suppose that at that very early age i actually remembered much of what had happened during the past eventful day  what i did feel was a sort of horror of loneliness  instead of the whole five of us snuggling warmly together in our well lined drey  i was here in this box  which was many times larger than our nest  absolutely alone  every time i went to sleep i would wake up again with a start  vaguely feeling round for my mother and the rest  and shivering miserably in my unaccustomed solitude   at last morning came  and it was hardly broad daylight before jack arrived in his nightshirt and carried me off  cage and all  to his bedroom  where he put me on the window ledge in the sun and offered me nuts  at first i was much alarmed  but he was so gentle that i gradually got over my terror  and sat up and nibbled the nuts fairly happily   i will pass over the next few days  my new master fed me assiduously  and very soon i lost all fear of him  and the minute i saw him would make for the door of my comfortable little prison  and wait eagerly for the dainties which were sure to be forthcoming  every morning he changed my bed and gave me fresh hay  which makes far the best bedding for any of our tribe  during the day my cage was brought down into the bowling alley  where several other pets were kept  and at night jack took me up to his room  so that i might not be frightened by servants dusting in the morning   at last there came a morning when jack s hand  instead of offering me the usual nut  gently grasped me  frightened  i turned at once and bit him sharply  i don t suppose my small teeth did much damage  for he only laughed  and  lifting me right out of the cage  placed me on his bed  the white counterpane was so very different from anything which i had ever felt under my claws before  that at first i was too much surprised to move  and remained perfectly still  presently  however  jack popped a nut down in front of me  that  at any rate  i understood  so i sat up on my hind quarters  cracked it  and  first carefully removing the brown skin from the kernel  made short work of the dainty   hoping for more  i gained confidence and proceeded to explore  first i caught my claws in the little projecting tufts of the counterpane  and heard jack laughing gently as i shook myself impatiently free  giving a little squeak of disgust  presently i discovered a cavity that looked dark and inviting  you know a squirrel s besetting sin is curiosity  he always wants to know the ins and outs of everything  any object which he has not seen before fascinates him  and i am afraid to say how many of my friends have paid for their inquisitiveness by getting into serious trouble  so i crawled down  and finding it delightfully warm and dark  made my way under the clothes to the very foot of the bed  where  as i was very comfortable  i went sound asleep   on the next morning my master turned me loose again  this time on the floor  and after a fresh access of timidity i again found nuts  there were more than i wanted  so  obeying a natural instinct  i ate what i could  and hid the rest in various convenient receptacles   soon i began to look forward to my daily outing  and took great delight in exploring every corner of the room  i well recollect what a shock i got the first time i reached the window sill  outside was a great elm tree  whose branches reached within a few yards of the window  and the sight of the green leaves waving gently in the early morning breeze roused in me strange longings  i made one jump  and striking full against the glass  fell back half stunned and terrified almost out of my wits at the strange transparent barrier  jack picked me up at once  and placed me safe in the darkness and warmth under the bedclothes  where i had time to recover from my fright   soon he took to letting me out at bedtime  and i had a grand scamper before the light was put out  the window curtains were my favourite resort  they were so easy to climb  and had such splendid folds and crannies for hiding nuts in  i would race across the curtain pole  rattling the rings as i went  down the other curtain  round the room full tilt  and finish up with a good hunt in all the corners for nuts which i had concealed the day before and forgotten all about  i rarely went back to my cage to sleep  though it was always open and ready for me  a fold in the window curtain was my usual place of repose  and another pet perch was an old band box on the top of the wardrobe  it was half full of tissue paper  which possessed a strange fascination for my young mind  i tore it all up fine with my sharp teeth  and made a most delicious nest with the bits   when the night was chilly i generally snuggled under jack s bedclothes  and always  first thing in the morning  so soon as daylight came  i would make for the bed  and working my way gently down between the sheets  curl up close against jack s toes  sometimes he was so sleepy that he would not wake up and play when i wanted him to  then i would emerge on to the pillow and gently nibble the tip of his nose   this never failed  ‘confound you  nipper    he always called me nipper   he would mutter drowsily  and then make a lazy grab  which i always eluded with the greatest ease  and with two bounds would land on the end of the bedstead  and  perched there  scold him until he sat up and threw a sock at me   he was never rough  and never lost his temper with me  although i am sure that i was aggravating enough at times  it must have been trying when he pulled on his boots in a hurry and found a couple of nuts wedged tight in each toe  i do not think that a boy and a squirrel ever became better chums  we were simply devoted to one another  the only dull times for me were when jack and harry were busy with their tutor  during which hours i was usually in my box in the bowling alley   there  as i think i mentioned before  the fortescue boys kept several other pets  there was a large white cockatoo with a lemon crest  named joey  which frightened and puzzled me horribly until i came to understand its odd faculty of imitating every person and animal about the place  it would ‘miaouw  like a cat  a most disturbing sound  for every squirrel hates cats next to hawks and weasels  would bark so realistically that mrs  fortescue s white pomeranian was always stirred up to reply  and the two would go on and on  the wily old bird always starting up afresh whenever the dog stopped  until poor pom nearly had a fit and grew quite hoarse  i shall never forget the first time he imitated me to my face  it gave me a most severe shock  for he did it so well that for a moment i believed that one of my relations was actually in the room  one thing i liked him for  he was devoted to jack  and invariably bade him a grave ‘good morning  when he brought my cage down before breakfast  he lived on a perch  to which he was chained by one leg  and up and down this he would sidle by the hour  with one eye cocked for mischief  sometimes  when all was quiet  he would talk to himself in a language quite unlike that which my master and his family used  the boys said it was some african lingo which joey had learnt ages ago in his native land  altogether a most uncanny bird   harry had a number of pet mice in wire cages  they were not the least atom like any of the mice i had ever seen in the wood  these were of the queerest colours—piebald—and some of them had marks on their backs just the shape of a saddle  uninteresting i called them  but harry was very fond of them  and used to take them out and let them run all over him   in the darkest corner of the long  low room was the one creature that  from the first moment i saw it  interested me more than all the others put together  all day long it lay hidden in its hay bed and never moved  but slept quietly as a dormouse in its winter nest  in fact  i never set eyes on it at all until one night in august  when the evenings had begun to draw in and i happened to be left a little later than usual in the bowling alley  no sooner had the room become dusk than i heard from the tiny cage a little twittering  more like a young bird s voice than anything else  and presently caught sight of a dainty little head poked out of the hay  with two of the largest  most liquid black eyes i ever saw  i gazed in wonder  for the animal was so like myself that i felt sure it was a squirrel  though i had never dreamed that any squirrel existed so tiny as this   just then in came the two boys together    illustration  he imitated me to my face   ‘hulloa   cried harry  ‘lops is awake  bring nipper to have a look at him  jack    jack took me out of my cage  and i jumped as usual on to his shoulder and nibbled his ear by way of a kiss  he walked across to the other cage and set me down in front of it   ‘mr  lops   he said with mock gravity  ‘allow me to introduce mr  nipper  this is a small cousin of yours  nipper  and he comes from mexico  as you see yourself  he s a sad character—sleeps all day and only wakes up at night    i was so lost in surprise that i sat quite still  gazing through the fine wire mesh at my new acquaintance  i have always had a fairly good opinion of my own looks  as every well bred squirrel should have  but  upon my word  he put me out of all conceit with myself  he was the tiniest  daintiest  quaintest creature i ever set eyes on  no bright red about him  but though his coat was darker and greyer than mine  it was as soft as fine velvet  and beautifully groomed  his head was perfectly shaped  his ears pricked like my own  and his eyes very large and amazingly bright  but the oddest thing about him were the folds of loose skin which extended in a thin membrane from all his four legs back to his body  when he jumped from the upper  story of his cage to the lower  they spread out almost like the wings of a bat  but when he was sitting still  they folded up so that they did not in the least spoil his beautiful shape  i must say that i felt quite envious  for i thoroughly understood that a squirrel built like that could jump ever so much further than i or any of my family could  we english squirrels can  at a pinch  clear as much as three yards in a straight line  we always spread our legs wide when we jump as well as keeping our tails stretched straight out  and that is why we can leap from great heights and reach the ground unhurt  for we drop parachute fashion  but as for these american cousins of ours  the flying squirrels  they can jump from the top of one tree  and sliding through the air like a soaring hawk  reach another tree fifty feet or more away at a height from the ground only slightly less than that of their starting point   lops—which jack said was short for nyctalops  or ‘seer by night —and i had many a chat afterwards  he told me of his old home in sunny mexico  not a nest such as i was born in  but a cavity in the trunk of a vast live oak or ilex  from whose boughs long weepers of grey spanish moss trailed towards the brown palmetto stained water below  of the hot sun and of the furious tropical storms which lashed the deep river into white foam  of the paroquets  with their brilliant plumage of green and red and blue  which screamed harshly among the upper branches at dawn  of the rusty hued water vipers which coiled sluggishly on the steaming mud in summer  he told  too  of the perils from great hawks three times as large as any we know in england  from long  thin tree snakes wrapped unseen round the branches  and i shuddered when he talked of fierce wild cats as much at home among the tree tops as on the ground  it must have been a wonderful country and a wonderful life  so different from our northern island as to be almost beyond my imagination to picture it  all day the land slept breathless beneath the blazing sun  with nothing moving except the birds  the fox squirrels  and the lizards  and during those hours lops and his family slept in the dark recesses of their wood walled fortress  but when the sun set the forest woke to life  deer came down to the river to drink  peccaries rooted in droves among the bases of the mighty trees  sometimes a great bear came prowling along  uttering now and then a deep ‘woof  when any unaccustomed sound disturbed him  up above opossums and racoons moved silently to and fro among the tree tops  great owls whirled on soft wings  hooting dismally  while all night long—especially in the hot season—the endless chirr of crickets  the pipe of tree frogs and the deep booming of bull frogs filled the air with a never ending concert  other sounds there were  rarer  but far more terrifying  enormous bull alligators  floating like logs with only their gnarled heads and the ridges of their rugged backs above the water  would bellow with a roar that shook the forest  or  again  from some hidden recess of the deepest woods the blood curdling shriek of the tawny puma would ring hideously through the night   poor lops  though cared for as few pets are—fed with dainty pecan nuts and other delicacies from his far off home across the ocean  and though he loved his mistress mabel  jack s sister  devotedly—yet he was never happy as i was  the damp and cold of our climate oppressed him  and most of his time he spent curled up tightly among the soft bedding of his cage  then  too  he was a creature of the night  and it was only after dark that he would wake and want to play—and at that time  except for an hour or two  there was no one to play with  i felt very sorry for him  and so  too  were mabel and the boys  i am sure that if they could they would have set him free again among the great tropical forests that he loved so well  and always mourned for  though only i knew how deeply   as for me  life ran most pleasantly  i grew plump on the good food i was supplied with  my coat became long and sleek  and my tail  which had been a mere furry appendage like that of a little colt  grew into a glorious brush of richest red brown  long enough and thick enough to cover me completely when i curled up to sleep  jack was very proud of my looks  and used to groom me all over with a little brush—a process which i soon grew very fond of  we two came to understand one another most marvellously  i could always tell him what i wanted  whether it was food  or a game  or to be allowed to creep into his coat pocket and go to sleep there   one day he opened my cage  slipped me into his pocket  and walked off  and when he took me out again i was out of doors once more   i cannot tell you how it affected me  you know  we wild creatures—born wild  i mean—never quite forget our rightful heritage of freedom  and here  for the first time for many weeks  i found myself out in the open   jack was seated on a wooden bench under a clump of evergreen shrubs in the midst of a great expanse of smooth shaven lawn  it was august now  and the sun poured down hotter than ever it had been in those june days in the wood  big bumble bees droned lazily by  a robin was perched on the bare ground at the foot of an  arbor vitæ   cocking a soft round eye at us  all the subtle  fascinating odours of summer were in my nostrils  i gave one spring from his knee on to the back of the bench  and sat there  head high  snuffing the sweet air  and quivering all over with excitement  jack never moved  and for the moment he passed completely out of my remembrance  my brain was crammed to bursting with half forgotten instincts and remembrances which crowded in upon me   so i sat for perhaps half a minute  then a little breath of summer breeze swayed a bough above me  and on the impulse i sprang  oh  the delight of feeling it yield and swing beneath me  i darted inwards to the trunk  and with one clattering dash was up at its slender summit twenty feet above the turf gazing round in wild delight  when the first ecstasy had worn off  i set myself to explore  and  clambering down a little  jumped into the next tree  so for many minutes i exercised my new found powers  taking longer and longer leaps  and enjoying myself to the top of my bent   but the clump of shrubs was small  and soon i had exhausted its resources in the way of jumps  i looked around  and a little way off was a giant elm  ah  that would give more scope  and with my head full of its possibilities  i turned and came down head foremost  then  and not till then  did my eyes fall upon my master  who sat where i had left him  still as ever  he looked at me  but i would not heed  and dashed off across the lawn   ‘hulloa  jack  what price nipper   came harry s voice from a distance  ‘you ll never see him again    but the other only said  ‘you wait   and still sat stubbornly in his place   with a rattle of claws on rough bark i was up the elm like a flash  and  half crazy with joy  went leaping and corkscrewing round and round  sending a couple of tree creepers off in a terrible fright  i think they must have taken me for a cat  i played for a long time  and still jack sat on the bench  he seemed to be deep in a book  and after a time i got quite cross at his apparent lack of interest in my proceedings  it was getting late  and the trees threw long  dark shadows across the lawn  the breeze had died down  and  except for the chirping of sparrows in the ivy and the low whistle of some starlings in the distance  all was very still  a sense of loneliness began to oppress me  and at last i came creeping down  and  reaching the lower branch  once more looked across towards my master   ‘nipper   he called softly  and in a trice i was on the ground and lopping across towards him   suddenly  and without the slightest warning  there was a sharp ‘yap yap   and a dirty white and tan beast rushed out of the shrubbery behind me  on the instant i was running for dear life   i saw jack bound to his feet and come tearing across towards me  but instead of running straight to him  i made for the nearest tree—a small ornamental evergreen  the dog—it was the gardener s terrier—wheeled  and was after me like a shot  he was travelling nearly twice as fast as i  and his feet were drumming so close behind me that it seemed nothing could save me  each instant i expected to feel those snapping teeth close upon me   there was a sudden crash  and the sharp ‘yap yap   changed to a terrified howl  jack had hurled his book with all his might and with such good aim that the dog  hit full in the side  had been bowled completely over  giving me time to gain the shrub and safety   ‘poor old nipper   said jack softly  as he picked me shivering out of the little tree and stowed me safely inside the breast of his coat  ‘we won t run any more risks of that sort  will we  old chap    indeed  the fright was so severe that i did not get over it for some time  it gave me a good lesson  and the next time my master let me out i did not venture far from him   soon after this i had another adventure which came very near to closing my career abruptly  one dull rainy morning i was loose as usual in jack s bedroom  just as he had almost finished dressing  his brother  whose room was on the same floor  opened the door and called to my master to come and help him to find one of his mice which had got loose and disappeared  jack ran out  carefully closing the door behind him  and leaving me to play by myself  a few minutes afterwards one of the maids  thinking no doubt that jack had finished dressing and had gone down to his early morning lesson with his tutor  came in to turn the bed down and tidy up  she never saw me  and i paid no attention to her  for i was busy under the dressing table with some nuts   it was some minutes after she had gone away that i became conscious of an animal moving softly about the room  and a spasm of terror seized me  for though i could not see it owing to the hangings of the dressing table  instinct—that sixth sense which informs us of danger—gave me warning of desperate peril   crouching back as near to the wall as possible  i lay there absolutely still  listening with beating heart to the almost noiseless footsteps which came gradually nearer and nearer  i could tell by the soft snuffing that the animal scented me  and terror almost paralysed me  closer and even closer came the creature  and presently the hangings of the table rustled  and as they were pushed aside a whiskered head appeared  and two eyes that glowed luminous green in the dim light glared upon me  stiffened in my corner i watched the cat crouch for a spring  her gleaming eyes fixed greedily upon me  while her tail waving quickly from side to side  made a soft tattoo on the carpet  those cruel green eyes absolutely fascinated me  and for the moment i could not have moved even to save my life   suddenly came a loud crash  the door left open by the maid had blown to in the strong draught from the open window  the noise startled the cat almost as much as it did me  and for the moment she took her eyes off me  the spell was broken and i ran for dear life  as i passed under the hangings and out into the open i heard her heavier  larger body strike the very spot where i been crouching  and with another spring she came out from under the table and landed barely her own length behind me  one wild bound to the right and i was inside the fender  another  and my enemy s outstretched paw actually grazed my tail as i bolted clean up the chimney  and a snarl of disappointed rage gave me the glad tidings that i was for the moment safe   it was lucky  indeed  for me that the chimneys of the hall were of the wide  old fashioned brick type unprovided with dampers  had it not been so  and had my refuge been the modern  narrow  perpendicular form of grate  it is certain that i should never have been alive now  as it was  the worn  old brickwork gave me footing of a kind  and i never stopped until i had reached the chimney pot  which barred further progress  the soot nearly choked me  and made me cough and sneeze violently  my foothold was most precarious and i was in deadly terror that i might slip and go tumbling right back into the jaws of my enemy  indeed  i have rarely spent a worse quarter of an hour than i did then   suddenly i heard the door below open  sounds came to me almost as clearly as if i had been in the room   ‘nipper  nipper   i heard jack call  but i was too frightened to come down   ‘why  where on earth has he got to   my master continued in a surprised tone  and then i heard him moving about the room looking for me   the cat  no doubt  had taken refuge under the dressing table again when she heard the door open  for she knew as well as possible that she had no right in the bedrooms  her proper place being the kitchen  there was a rustle as jack raised the hangings  and then he saw her   for the moment there is no doubt but that he thought she had killed and eaten me  and grief and fury possessed him  i heard a smothered squawk of terror  and even in my plight rejoiced that my enemy was feeling a little of the fright she had given me  then there was a crash  jack had flung the beast clean out of the window into the elm opposite  i heard him go to the door again  and there was something in his voice as he shouted to his brother to come that made me shiver all over  but not with fright   harry came rushing into the room  and i am bound to say his voice was almost as queer as that of my master   i was recovering slowly from my terror  and the sound of jack s voice was giving me confidence  also my present refuge was horribly uncomfortable  and the black soot making me feel perfectly miserable  so i turned with the intention of making my way downwards again  you know we squirrels always descend head foremost  holding on with our hind claws  but i had hardly begun my descent when a bit of hardened soot or plaster gave way beneath me  i made a desperate but quite useless effort to recover myself  and next thing i was sliding helplessly down the steep slope at a pace which increased with every foot i fell   thud  and i landed in the grate amid a perfect avalanche of soot  jack  who was sitting on the bed looking more miserable than i had ever seen him before  sprang to his feet as if electrified  and cleared the intervening space with a bound   ‘nipper  nipper  is it you   he shouted  and regardless of his smart  clean flannel suit picked me up and positively hugged me in a transport of delight  then he examined me all over to make sure that i was not hurt  and after that i was only too glad to be allowed to crawl into his pocket and feel that there  at any rate  i was safe   the worst of it came after breakfast  for i was too filthy to be able to clean myself  such a miserable  draggled little object i was  black as any sweep  my master got a basin of warm water and washed me all over—a process which i remember i strongly objected to  and resented by nipping his fingers sharply  but he was firm  and presently i was back again in my cage  which was placed before the kitchen fire  and jack himself kept watch over me until  once more dry and clean  i was fit to return to the bowling alley      chapter iv  a day in rat land   it was about this time that an unaccustomed quiet seemed to be settling upon the hall and the demesne  there were less people about  no visitors  and some familiar faces among the servants were missed  i had never seen much of the squire himself  but in these days he seldom came into the bowling alley at all  as he had been used to do in the earlier days of my captivity  even the boys seemed to have grown quieter  they laughed less often  and frequently i saw them talking to one another with grave faces   at times i had an uneasy conviction of something wrong  but it was only a passing impression  for i  at least  never suffered in any way  every fine day jack took me out of doors  and i had a scamper in the clump of shrubs to which  ever since my narrow escape from the terrier  i was careful to confine myself  and as for food  no squirrel could have fared better  my master was always bringing me fresh delicacies  one day it would be a cob of indian corn  which grew to perfection under the south wall of the kitchen garden  and which i enjoyed vastly  ripping off the thick green husks and pulling the kernels out one by one  another morning he would pick me a fine summer apple  its sunny side delicately tinged with streaky red  while he was always discovering new nuts for my delectation  once  i remember  i made myself quite ill with the rich greasy kernel of a huge brazil nut  a very pet delicacy of mine in which i was often indulged was a piece of hard ship s biscuit  there were few other eatables which i enjoyed so much  now and then i was given a morsel of banana  and perhaps my greatest treat of all was a few of the black  oily seeds of the sunflower   so things went on until the time that the blackberries began to ripen  then  one warm sunny morning jack got up very early and dressed quickly  i wanted to play as usual  but he seemed to have no time  and i was quite hurt at his apparent neglect  as he took me in my cage to the bowling alley the squire was in the hall  i had never seen him there so early  he looked old  and worn  and there were new lines in his face  while his hair and beard seemed greyer than i had thought them   ‘be quick and have your breakfast  jack   i heard him say  ‘your train goes at nine  remember    ‘all right  dad   returned the boy  ‘take care of nipper while i m gone    then  when he had put me in my place in the bowling alley just opposite old joey s perch  he did a very unusual thing—took me out again and stroked me  then he put me back very gently and hurried away   the morning passed  but when afternoon came and i looked for my master  as usual  there was no sign of him  i scratched vehemently at my cage door  but no one came  only old joey made rude remarks and began to mimic me  so at last i retired in a very bad temper  and curling up in my hay began to wonder whether jack had forgotten me  you see we had never been separated for a single day  and i could not in the least understand his absence   at last some one came in  and i jumped out eagerly  but  to my great disappointment  it was harry  not jack  who came up and opened the door of my cage  ‘poor old nipper   he said  and held out his hand  inviting me to come with him   i came eagerly enough  for i had the idea that he would take me to my master  the two brothers were so nearly inseparable that i could not imagine one being long away from the other  he did not  however  carry me out of doors  but up to his own room  where he turned me loose and offered me biscuit  but i am afraid he found me a dull companion  for i was listening the whole time for jack s familiar footstep  and did not pay much attention to his friendly overtures  at last he took me back to the bowling alley and shut me up again  and there i moped sulkily for the rest of the day   night came on  and no jack  i could not eat  but sat awake all night  hoping for and expecting my master  next morning harry came to feed me  and was horrified when he found that i had not eaten my supper  he brought me every delicacy that he could think of  and at last  just to please him  i ate a nut or two  that evening he was taking me up to his room again  but as we got to the door i hopped out of his pocket and scampered off to jack s door  he let me in  and though it was a fresh and bitter disappointment not to find my master  yet i felt a little happier among the familiar surroundings  and plucked up spirit enough to dig out a nut which i had hidden in his big bath sponge and eat it  so that night harry turned me loose in his brother s room  i went to bed in a pocket of one of jack s old coats which hung against the door  and tried hard to imagine that my master was wearing it   it was morning when i poked my head out  there was the smooth  white  empty bed  and still no sign of jack  presently the maid came in  and not seeing me  opened the window to air the room  after she had gone i clambered out of the coat pocket and began aimlessly wandering about the room  presently i found myself on the window sill  and  catching sight of the elm branches waving close by  with one spring i was in the tree  and  running down the trunk  rapidly reached the grass  outside the shadow of the tree the wide  smooth lawn sparkled with thick dew  i had never been out so early before  and i greatly disliked the cold wetness of the grass  but so anxious was i to find jack that i hardly thought of the discomfort  and i made my way with all speed to the bench where he so often sat   but he was not there  all was deserted and strangely quiet  only the thrushes hopped past searching for their breakfast of worms  and a robin sang from the sunny summit of a clump of evergreens   often i had perched upon jack s shoulder as he strolled round to the stables to see his pony tarbrush  to visit the stable was the next idea that came to me  and keeping as close as possible to the friendly shrubs and trees  i worked quickly round through the garden till i came to the belt of laurels which lay between the back premises and the stables   i felt happier when i was off the ground and among the branches of the shrubs  and climbing quickly through them  soon came to the gate of the stable yard   there were cats here  i had seen them on my previous visits  and under any other circumstances nothing would have induced me to venture alone into the long  paved yard  but anxiety to find my master swallowed up all other considerations  and dropping from the laurels  i made straight for the door of tarbrush s stall   there was no one in sight  only from a stall on the other side came the hissing of a groom busy about a horse   imagine my dismay to find tarbrush s loose box empty  so  too  were the other boxes in the same building  the place was absolutely deserted and deathly still  feeling more lonely and miserable than ever  i turned uncertainly  i did not know where to go or what to do next  then i remembered that there was one other place where jack had sometimes taken me—an old and long disused stable at the far end of the yard  where his sister mabel kept her hutches of tame rabbits   the place was large and cool and dark  the windows had long ago been boarded up  and the back was shaded by thick shrubbery  through which the early sun had not yet pierced  i moved just inside the door  and sat up  listening keenly  but all that i could hear was the munch  munch of the rabbits  teeth as they ate their breakfast of crisp leaves and roots  there was no human in the place   at that moment a new sound broke upon my ear  a slight rustling  brushing noise  then  before i could even turn  a large tabby cat came round the corner of the doorway  it was my old enemy  the same who had so nearly caught me in jack s bedroom  she was walking very slowly  rubbing her arched back against the wall as she went  and  terrified as i was  i had sense enough to see that she had not yet noticed me  i did the only thing i could—crouched down close against the wall and remained there still as a hare in her forme  hardly even breathing   for a moment i fancied that she would pass on  but i had forgotten her keen sense of smell  suddenly she threw her head up and began snuffing the air  then with one quick bound leaped inside the doorway  and stood there perfectly still glaring about her with great  round green eyes   i did not wait  but ran for dear life  as i started so did she  and to the best of my belief she jumped clean over me  i certainly felt the wind of her paw as she struck at my head   in the old stable the mangers and racks were still in place and the ruinous remains of the partitions of the stalls  more by good luck than anything else  i chanced upon a worm eaten oak post at the end of one partition and bolted up it  it led straight up through a gap in the ceiling  and i thought i was safe  i was sadly mistaken  this cat was almost as good a climber as i  and up she came at my very brush   scuttling up the wall of the loft  i reached a cross rafter  not twice my own length ahead of my hunter  the cat was not quite so quick in getting on to the rafter as i was  and that gave me a short start   a patch of sunlight came through a glassless window under the gable at the far end  and instinctively i made for this  jumping frantically from rafter to rafter  there was no time for plans  it was just one wild dash for any chance of safety   the rafters were not very wide apart  not too far for me to jump from one to another with fair ease  but they were rough hewn and narrow at the top  and the heavier cat could not get a foothold so quickly as i  so i gained all the way to the window  the second rafter from the window was a very narrow and awkward one  even i found it hard to balance myself upon it  as i did so  i caught a glimpse of something hanging from the last rafter  the only one left between me and the window  it was a peculiar looking  pear shaped object  grey in colour  rough in texture  and in size rather larger than my body  i knew well enough what it was  though in my fright i barely noticed it  next instant i had landed just above it  then  gathering all my powers for a longer leap than any before  launched myself towards the window sill  i just succeeded in reaching it  only to find that the opening was covered with wire netting  i was hopelessly trapped   hot foot after me came the cat  she could jump as well or better than i  but  as i said before  the narrowness of the beams bothered her  when she reached the narrowest  the second from the window  she had all she could do to keep her balance  the result was that her next jump was a trifle short  her fore paws clutched the beam  but her hind feet failed to reach it  and struggling desperately to pull herself up  she drove her hind claws deep into the pear shaped object which hung exactly below her   instantly there arose a deep toned buzzing  and the air was thick with a cloud of furious wasps  there followed a perfect squeal of pain and terror  and my enemy  covered with a swarm of the fierce little stinging insects  dropped with a resounding thump on to the boards below  and fled like a mad thing  pursued by scores of angry wasps   the wasps rose to the very roof  they were all round me  i made one frantic scramble up the rusty netting  found a hole  squeezed through anyhow  and just as the first wasp landed on my back and drove a vicious sting through my thick fur  took a wild jump in the direction of the nearest shrub   the distance was too much for me  my fore paws just touched the leaves  and i went sailing downwards into the deep shadows beneath  down  down into absolute blackness  to land at last with a shock that for the moment completely deprived me of my few remaining senses  fortunately for us squirrel folk and all other animals except man  we never remain insensible for long  i was all awake again in a very few moments  and found myself lying on a thick bed of damp  decaying leaves  it was almost pitch dark  but a little light which leaked down from somewhere high above showed me that i was at the bottom of a deep hole  with perpendicular sides of mouldering brickwork   but this was not what set my heart beating again almost as thickly as a moment previously  it was a peculiar  musty  unpleasant odour  which made me instinctively spring up against the side of the hole and struggle hard to climb back to daylight  but rough as the walls of my prison were  my claws could get no grip  and i fell back panting and helpless to the bottom  again and again i tried  the brickwork was very old  covered with close green moss and riddled with holes  and more than once i succeeded in climbing a good distance up the sides  but i always came at last to some place where i could find no foothold  and went sliding helplessly down to the bottom again   soon i was quite exhausted  i had eaten hardly anything since jack left  and the escape from the cat and the shock of my long fall had taken it out of me badly  at last i was forced to give it up and lay at full length breathing hard upon the sodden leaves   presently came a soft rustling sound  then a slight squeak  by this time my eyes were well accustomed to the gloom  and looking upwards  there at the mouth of one of the holes a sharp black nose appeared and a pair of beady  black eyes which stared at me fixedly  a moment later another nose showed from another hole  then a third  and a fourth  more and more came out  until the whole of the slimy old wall seemed alive with them  and all with their keen unwinking eyes fixed upon me as i crouched helpless in the bottom of the old dry well    illustration  the whole of the slimy old wall seemed alive with them    in the woods we squirrels seldom trouble about rats  in some of the old banks and hedgerows there are hundreds of them  but they don t interfere with us as they do with the earth livers and with the birds that nest on the ground  they cannot harm us tree dwellers  but we do not trust them  any more than do the rest of the woodland folk  cruel  cunning and treacherous  the grey hanoverian rat is the most detested and despised of all the animals  and the vile odour of his unclean body at once drives away all other creatures from his neighbourhood  for myself  i have and always had a perfect horror of rats  mother once told us a ghastly story of how one of our people  accidentally caught in a steel trap  was literally eaten alive by rats  and here i was  in an almost equally helpless case  at the mercy of a score of the carrion brutes   if there had been only one of them  i should not have been afraid  a solitary rat is always a coward  but in packs they are as fierce as weasels  for a long time they watched me without moving  the musty carrion odour grew worse and worse  presently there was more rustling  and i saw the heads pushed out farther and farther from the dark recesses in the sides of the well  then they began to squeak  they were talking  asking one another if it was safe to attack me  suddenly one great brute  as big again as i  dropped from his hole almost on top of me  fright gave me strength to make a last bid for life  i made another wild dash at the side of my prison  and instantly the rats all vanished  this time i was lucky enough to find a piece of wall rough enough to give me foothold  and though my claws slipped again and again  yet each time i managed somehow to save myself  and at last reached a deep  square niche in the wall where a number of bricks seemed to have fallen out  here there was room to sit  and i had sense enough to stay where i was and rest before trying anything else   my rush had only frightened the rats for the moment  very soon the rustling and squeaking began again  and louder than before  the heads reappeared  and as each came out the keen nose was turned upwards and the beady eyes fixed upon me again  two or three sprang down into the bottom of the well and began snuffing about  i saw several little ones appear  all the rats were very quiet and leisurely in their movements  evidently they felt perfectly certain that i could not escape  i could see them licking their greasy lips in anticipation of their meal   certainly i was better off in one way  i had climbed so high that now i was above their ring of holes  but above me the brickwork was less decayed  there was no foothold at all  plainly i could not possibly climb any higher  even if the rats did not come after me where i was  it was only a matter of time before i was starved out and dropped down amongst them   a long time passed  and though the rats still moved about at the bottom of the well  none came near me  i saw the sunlight begin to pierce through the shrubs above  and patches of light shone on the rusty iron railings which surrounded the top of the old well  and even gleamed on the green moss which coated its sides  but none reached me where i crouched  shivering in the cold and damp   a dog barked somewhere up above  and then at last i heard human footsteps pass across the crackling leaves close to the well mouth  they were harry s  i shivered all over with excitement  and gave the little bark which was my call to jack  but evidently he did not hear me  and the steps passed on  and all was quiet again  even the rats had stopped squeaking  and most of them had gone back to their holes  only the old buck who had jumped down at first was sitting in front of his hole below and opposite me  seemingly half asleep  but really keeping a watchful eye upon me   the sunlight slowly faded  and the shadow of the stable fell across the mouth of the well  night was coming—night  when the rats would surely attack me  i was desperately hungry  though i do not think that just then i could have eaten the finest nut in the coppice  at last the first star twinkled overhead  for some time the rats had been moving again  i could hear them  though i could not see them  the bustle increased with the darkness  and there was more squeaking   presently i heard something climbing towards me  it was the father rat  of that i was certain  though i could not see him  he came up slowly but steadily  and i shook all over with fresh panic   all day i had sat quite still in my nook  staring upwards in the hope of seeing jack s head up above  i had not even once taken a look round my place of refuge  now  as my enemy came stealthily nearer i backed into the recess  the hole ran in further than i had supposed  and i went in twice my own length before touching the brickwork   suddenly there was a slight snuffing sound  the rat was over the edge  and right upon me  what happened next i hardly know  i made a blind  panic stricken rush  and found myself wedged between two bricks  the rat s jaws closed upon my brush  i struggled madly  and suddenly i was free and scuttling away down a sort of tunnel  away i went  bumping against the top and sides  but still finding room to run   seemingly the great rat had been unable to squeeze through the narrow aperture in which even my small self had been caught for the moment  but at the time i do not think that i knew that  my one idea was to run  and run i did  plunging blindly on and on through the black dark like a rabbit with a stoat at its scut  i remember very little about that horrible tunnel or how i got through it  i only know that it was wet and slimy in places  and that it seemed as though i could not breathe  if it had not been for the fear of the rat i should never have been able to go on  but i fully believed that the bloodthirsty monster was behind me all the time  and each instant expected to feel the sharp teeth close upon me  so  breathless and suffocating  i kept on  until at last there was a break in the darkness  and next instant i tumbled headlong out of the mouth of a drain pipe into the muddy bed of a dried up pool   i was so absolutely exhausted that there i lay  quite unable to stir brush or claw  if any prowling cat or weasel had happened upon me i could not have lifted a paw to get away  but nothing did molest me  and after a long time i managed to struggle out of the mud and up the bank on to a patch of grass  when i looked round i found that i was in the hall kitchen garden   i knew my way from there to the house  and slowly and wearily dragged myself back  i made for the elm by jack s window  climbed up it  and  finding a nook in a fork between two boughs  curled up  and was fast asleep in a moment   in the morning i saw that the window was wide open  so  jumping in  i climbed upon jack s bed and curled my muddy little body up on the pillow   there harry found me  and i am bound to say that jack himself never made as much fuss about me as his brother did on that occasion      chapter v  back to the woodlands   about four in the afternoon of the next day i was lying half asleep in my cage in the bowling alley when a sound in the distance made me spring up  quivering all over with excitement  next moment the door burst open  and in rushed jack  he never even waited to take off his hat or gloves  but ran up the long room  and flung open my cage door  with one bound i was on his shoulder  nosing him and biting his ears and hair in a perfect transport of delight  and i think he was just as glad as i was   presently his sister s voice called him from behind  he turned and kissed her  and with me still on his shoulder  followed her to the hall  where the squire and mrs  fortescue were at tea   after this jack and i became more inseparable than ever  he had holidays—these days—and i simply lived in his pocket  the next afternoon there was great excitement  i heard every one congratulating jack  though of course i did not in the least comprehend why his mother and sister hugged and kissed him  and the squire solemnly shook hands with him  it was just as well for me that i did not realize what had happened  or those lovely september days would have been the most miserable instead of the happiest in the whole of my life  for jack had passed an examination with the result that in a few weeks he would have to go and live and work in london—a dreadful place  i understand—where it is all houses and no trees  where the sun never shines  and where the only wild creatures that exist are those cheeky  chattering thieves  the sparrows   harry  too  was always with his brother at this time  and they talked more than i had ever known them to do before   the two were very serious one day  lying on their backs beneath the trees on the lawn while i ran all over them both impartially  and from the way in which they turned to me and caught me up every now and then  as well as because i heard my own name frequently spoken  i came to the conclusion the conversation had something to do with my fate  and there was no doubt it had  for it was after this time they all left the hall  and when i visited it again there were strangers—but i mustn t go on too fast  i fancy jack urged harry to keep me while he himself was away  and harry shook his head  perhaps he was afraid i might mope away  as i did before in jack s absence  and end by dying  anyway  a gloomy silence settled again between the brothers  at last jack started up and waved his hand energetically in the direction of the wood  then  springing to his feet  he called to me to come to him  i had leaped away in affright at his sudden movements  to which i never could get accustomed  but i returned again at once  jack had quite sense enough to know squirrels mate for life  and the young ones usually stay with their parents all the winter  and he knew  what i did not  that mother and hazel and rusty would still be in the coppice to greet me  and teach me all the wild wood lore  even though my father was dead   the brothers argued for some time over my prospective fate  but i did not really understand until later  when their actions showed me what they meant  i had leaped from jack s shoulder during this weighty conversation  and was enjoying myself hugely  tearing round and round the two boys  and making an occasional dive into jack s pocket after the nuts and grains of wheat and maize which were always to be found there  but  after all  i was not taken away to the woodlands at once   three or four days later jack again got up very early  and as he dressed i could hear out on the drive a great grinding of heavy wheels  as jack hurried down he took me on his shoulder instead of putting me in my cage  his brother joined him on the stairs  and they walked down side by side  as solemnly as two old crows   the hall was full of crates and matting  and men in green baize aprons were turning everything upside down  outside  in the ring  were great vans almost as big as cottages  the boys hardly wasted a glance on these things  but hurried past  and next moment were striding away across the dewy grass of the lawn   i was amazed at being taken out so early  but all the same very much delighted  and sat on my master s shoulder chattering with joy  neither brother spoke  but walked steadily on under the long morning shadows of the tall elms until they reached the ha ha which cut the garden off from the park  jumping down the sunk fence  they turned to the right  passed under the shadow of the wall of the kitchen garden  and along beside the laurel plantation beyond  a wicket gate led through the park fence and into a large field  in which red cattle were grazing   strange memories began to stir in my breast as a line of tall  thick timber came in sight on the far side of the meadow  and when my master jumped the little brook and walked up over some broken  sandy ground where the white scuts of rabbits bobbed among the bracken  towards the tall magpie hedge beyond  my heart was beating so violently that i could only sit quite still upon his shoulder and stare about me in a sort of mazed bewilderment   on through the gate  and at once we were plunged into deep  damp coolness  all the half forgotten odours of moss and bracken and rotting wood  and a hundred other woodland scents  rose to my distended nostrils and almost overpowered me  just then i could not have moved for the life of me   harry was the first to break the silence   ‘that s where i saw the little beggars the other day  jack   he said softly  and pointed to a tall beech tree whose leaves  just beginning to yellow with the first chill of autumn  hung motionless in the still morning air   then they both seated themselves on a mossy log and waited  still as two dormice  the wild things of the woods  frightened into silence at these early morning intruders  gradually regained confidence  a rabbit popped out of his hole and began feeding on the close turf  on which the autumn dew spangles gleamed in a patch of sunshine which struck through the leafy canopy overhead  a shrew mouse  intent on some business of his own  bustled noiselessly across the path  a woodpecker started his tap  tap  tap  as he industriously probed a rotten branch for his breakfast of fat grubs  two jays began calling harshly  and presently the flicker of their brilliant blue plumage glanced through the greenery  as for me  i had crept off jack s shoulder  and  sitting up straight on one end of the log  was struggling desperately to take it all in   the boys never moved nor spoke  but presently harry touched his brother gently  and pointed very cautiously towards the beech tree  i  too  was gazing with all my eyes up into the tree  my heart throbbing more violently than ever  for down the smooth grey bark a patch of red brown fur was softly stealing with slow  deliberate steps  clutching tightly at unseen footholds with outstretched claws  the boys saw him  and so did i  but we none of us moved  as for me  my feelings were beyond words   nearer he came  and now i saw that he was almost my own double  his head was stretched out at right angles to his body  and his eyes  bright as two jewels  were fixed upon me with intensest curiosity  presently he reached the lowest bough  and there stood motionless as i was  and staring at me with a strange intensity  the calls of kindred were clamouring in my veins  and all of a sudden the spell was broken  without one backward look at my dear master  i jumped from the log  raced across the ground between it and the tree  and with one rattle of claws was up on the huge  lowest branch   but behold  the apparition which had attracted me had disappeared  and i stared round in fresh wonder  suddenly came a little sharp cry  and down from the leaves above me dropped—my mother herself  she gave a sharp bark of astonishment   then i remembered  a mad transport of joy thrilled me through and through  and with one wild dash i tore away up the tree  corkscrewing madly round and round the huge trunk in the way we squirrels have when joy is beyond expression   mother was with me  and next instant a third squirrel joined in our mad frolic  it was my brother rusty  the squirrel whom i had seen first of all  and had failed to recognize after our long separation  before i reached the top  yet a fourth frantic dot of red fur was flashing round and round  barking madly  and i knew her for my sister hazel  i think we were all quite mad with joy for the time being  and we never ceased our crazy scamperings until  quite out of breath  we landed all together in a fork among the branches high up in the leafy summit of the tall beech tree  there we sat and began a talk that lasted i don t know how long  it was the most curious thing  i had been away from them all so long  and become so accustomed to human talk  that i could hardly make my family understand my adventures  and they  on their part  were surprised beyond measure that any of the humans  whom they had so long looked upon as their hereditary enemies  could possibly have been so kind to me  but at last they had all my story  and then  and not till then  did the recollection of jack come back to me   when i announced my intention of going down again to find my master  mother evidently thought i was quite out of my senses   ‘but you have escaped  surely you do not want to go back to live in your prison   she urged    illustration  the boys never moved or spoke    i explained all over again what a good friend he had been to me  how he had saved my life  how he had fed me with all sorts of dainties  indeed  i strongly recommended her and my brother and sister to come with me  there was plenty of room  i said  and i waxed enthusiastic over the unlimited supplies of nuts  and fruit  and grain without any trouble in looking for them   it was not the slightest good  mother declared that the notion of living inside burrows—for that was her idea of a house and its rooms—was altogether detestable  and only fit for rabbits and humans  and would most certainly kill her in a very short time  all i could do  after much urging  was to persuade my family to come down to the lower branch and watch me go and talk to jack   rusty was quite ready—he always had a bold  determined streak about him  but mother and hazel hung back  when we got down  there was my dear master sitting where i had left him  all alone  harry had left  his face lighted up when he saw me hopping along the branch above him  and he gave the little whistle i knew so well  and stood up  running to the pendent tip of the branch  i made a flying leap  and landed clean on the top of his cap   ‘why  nipper  nipper   he said  taking me on his hand and stroking me fondly  ‘i almost thought you had forgotten me    i nibbled his finger lovingly by way of apology  and signified that i was quite ready for a nut  it was promptly forthcoming  and then as i ate it he put me down on the log  and walking softly towards the tree  turned out two pockets stuffed with the finest hazel nuts  and piled them by handfuls into a hollow as high as he could reach   then he sat down again beside me  took me up and talked to me  and petted me for a long time  at last  very slowly and reluctantly  he put me back on the branch from which i had leaped down   ‘good bye  old chap   he said in a queer  unsteady voice  and suddenly turned and walked quickly away   to say that i was astonished would be putting it mildly  i was absolutely thunderstruck  but after a minute made up my mind it was some new kind of game  and prepared to follow   ‘scud  scud   i heard mother call  but i paid no attention  running along the branch as far as it would bear  i made a flying leap into the next tree  it had been my dear father s boast that he could travel from one end of our coppice to the other without once touching ground  and indeed i found no difficulty in doing the same  i was so excited that i thought nothing of jumps of six times my own length  for jack was walking very fast  and i was in a dreadful fright that i might be left behind   at the gate he turned and saw me  he stood a moment irresolute  then quickly vaulted the gate and started off across the field  at this i grew quite desperate  and dropping into the hedge scuttled along it  reached the gate post  and sitting straight up gave one sharp bark  at that my master turned again and hurried back   ‘oh  nipper  why can t you go home   he muttered  and picking me up  walked very fast back to the big beech tree   ‘good bye  once more  old fellow   he said stooping over me  and suddenly i was startled by a drop like rain falling on my head   looking up in amazement  i saw my dear master s face twisted as though in pain  but before i could make up my mind what was the matter  he suddenly pitched me gently back into the hollow where he had put me before  and brushing his sleeve across his face  fairly ran away down the path  before i well realized what had happened  he was lost to sight among the trees   as soon as i recovered a little from my astonishment  i started a second time for the gate  but before i reached it jack was half way across the field  and travelling so fast that i knew i could never catch him  and besides  i had always been terribly afraid of the ground ever since my escape from the terrier   i don t think that ever in my life have i felt so utterly miserable as when i realized that my master had abandoned me  you see  i could not understand it at all  and my one sensation was an utter and overwhelming loneliness  gradually  too  i became frightened  i had never been alone out of doors before  and this was all so different to the hall garden  the field seemed a vast green desert  and behind me the wood an illimitable rustling mystery full of unseen perils  how long i sat there straining my eyes after the vanished form of my master i do not know  but what roused me at last was a sudden rustle behind  which made me start violently  however  it was only rusty  who had followed me  and was seated on a swinging hazel bough in the hedge  staring at me in a perplexed fashion   ‘what s the matter  scud   he asked at last   i told him i felt very forlorn now that my master had left me  my brother could not believe that i wanted to follow him  such a thing was quite beyond his comprehension   when i assured him it was true  rusty looked as solemn as if he was now certain that i had quite taken leave of my senses   ‘what  you want to go back and live in those burrows when you ve got all the wood to roam in   he exclaimed  ‘i ll be shot if i can understand you  do you mean that you d rather spend your time all alone in a place you can t get out of than go foraging round with us all day as free as—as —rusty s imagination failed him  and he paused—‘well—as free as a squirrel  for there s no other creature in the woods that is as free as we are    i reminded him that i was used to being protected  and had never experienced anything but the utmost gentleness from jack and his family   ‘yes  i know  i m sure he is quite different from those red faced brutes who broke our nest down and killed poor father   replied rusty  ‘and he has left us nuts enough for a month  but all his kind are so big and so dull  they can t climb trees like us  or jump   and my brother made a splendid spring down to my side just to show what he could do  ‘it s no kind of life for a squirrel  my brush  but i should have taken the first chance to run off and come back home    then he gave a sudden low cry of warning  and instinctively i followed him as he bounded back into the thick of the hedge just as a hen sparrow hawk stooped like a falling stone out of the blue above  reaching the grass by a tuft of gorse a little way out in the field  there was a sharp cry  cut short almost before it was uttered  and then the feathered robber rose again  bearing in her crooked talons the struggling form of a linnet  a few small feathers floated away through the still  warm air  and all was over  the hawk sailed away towards a distant tree with her meal tight clutched between her claws   it was long since i had seen one of these everyday woodland tragedies  and it made me realize with a shock that now i had myself only to depend upon  with no strong human hand to aid me  frightened and unhappy  i followed rusty quietly back into the heart of the coppice  and that night saw me one of a furry ball of four  curled in a hole in the heart of the great beech      chapter vi  a narrow escape   i did not forget my master and settle down to my old out door life at once  every morning for many days i visited the gate at the end of the wood path  and sat there or in the hedge beside it  straining my eyes across the meadow in the hope that jack might come back once more  but never a sign of him or harry did i see  and though  as the leaves began to fall  it was quite easy to view the roof of the hall across the shrubberies  no smoke rose from the tall  twisted red brick chimney stacks   how good mother was to me in those days i well remember  she encouraged me to tell her all i could of the hall and its people  and all the incidents of my captivity  and she alone of my family seemed thoroughly to sympathize with me in my longing for my lost master   hazel  too  was very dear and good  and would listen with the greatest interest to my long yarns  she was a sweet little thing in those days  very small  but extremely well built and active  and  for a young squirrel  of a peculiarly rich colour  rusty  however  had little sympathy with my longings  he was already a large  powerful squirrel of an extremely independent turn of mind  and most extraordinarily bold and fearless  mother was in a constant state of anxiety about him  for he would go off on long expeditions quite alone  sometimes not coming home till nearly sunset  and ever since father s death mother had been nervous as a hare when any of her children were out of her sight   as for me  i soon became thoroughly at home in the wood  and could climb as well as either my brother or my sister  though i was at first by no means so adept at taking shelter as the other two  i had grown so accustomed to many sights and sounds ordinarily alarming to one of our tribe  that mother had often to scold me for exposing myself heedlessly to view on the rare occasions when people walked through the wood  and she had to show me all over again the tricks of lying out flat on a bough so that i could not be seen by passers by  or of supporting myself on a trunk beneath a sheltering branch when danger in the shape of a hawk threatened from above   the good and plentiful food with which i had always been supplied at the hall had made me fat and strong beyond what squirrels usually are at my age  there was very little difference now between me and rusty  though originally i had been smaller  it was lucky for me that i had been turned loose just at this special time of year  for autumn is  of course  the squirrel s harvest  and food was particularly plentiful that season  nuts were ripening among the yellowing leaves  acorns were to be had for the picking  the beech trees were full of mast  and when we tired of these there were spruce seeds and berries of every description   earlier in the year larch  fir  pine  and spruce tips had been our main sustenance  but these were now getting dry and old  for it was past the season of evergreen growth  and so we left them alone and fed almost entirely on nuts and seeds   about this time we had several days of soft warm rain  and after them part of the horse pasture which adjoined the coppice on the other side from the hall was thickly dotted each morning with little white buttons  which mother explained to me were mushrooms  we used to steal down across the wet grass in the mornings  brushing through the gossamer spiders  webs till our chests and paws were white with them  and feast royally on the tenderest and daintiest of the mushrooms  sometimes getting terrible frights when the village children who came to fill their baskets saw us  and clapped their hands to make us run   mother was a wonderful forager  i remember one morning how she stopped on the bank where the beech trees grow thickest  and after snuffing a moment or two  began to dig rapidly in the soft  black  loamy soil  presently she nosed out some little round objects covered with a dark skin  and pushed one over to me  never have i eaten anything more delectable than my first truffle  i can find them myself now as well as anyone   other fungi too were plentiful after that rain  some grew under the trees  some on rotten logs  others out in the open  some were good to eat—better even than mushrooms—but others were poisonous  mother never passed a new one without showing us which were fit to eat and which were not  there was a brilliant scarlet kind which she warned us against strongly  well i remember how she scolded me one day because just for fun i pulled one up  and stuck it stalk down in a fork of a tree  i did not repeat the experiment  for it left a bad taste in my mouth for hours afterwards   about this time my coat began to change  squirrels that are born early in the spring have fur of a greyish brown hue very like the coats that old squirrels put on in winter  but we  being june kittens  had summer suits of red brown without any ear tufts  or any hair on the palms of our hands  first  my tail changed and grew darker  much heavier and more bushy  it turned to a blackish brown  quite different from its previous bright chestnut red hue  my coat  too  began  but more slowly  to lose its ruddy tint  and to assume its winter colouring  i became dark brownish red on the head and back  my white under parts changed to grey  which spread along my sides  it also grew longer  softer and warmer  and my ear tufts began to show  during the summer a squirrel has but a few hairs on the points of the ears  but winter brings a thick tuft a full inch in length   we squirrels have a strange peculiarity  we are the only living creatures  so far as i know  who change our coats twice a year and our tails once only  as i have said  we change our coats in spring and again before the cold weather  but our tails once only—in autumn  a healthy squirrel looks at his best in late september and early october  for at that time his new brush is extremely bright  while his new grey brown coat is rich and long  both fade during the cold weather  the fur especially becoming during long frosts of a yellowish rusty hue  there are  i believe  some squirrels  near relatives of our own  living in canada  who turn almost white in winter  but as—luckily for ourselves—all we squirrels have the sense to sleep away most of the cold weather  we have not the same need to conceal ourselves by assuming the colour of the snow  as have arctic hares and foxes and many other animals which are obliged to work and forage for a living during the hard weather   but i was talking about the good times we had that autumn and the various delicacies we used to hunt  after the rain which brought such a crop of mushrooms  we had a week of wonderfully warm  soft  hazy weather  but then the wind switched round into the east  and for the first time in my life i understood what cold was  it blew bitterly  with a hard grey sky  and the trees being still full of leaves  the noise of the gale through the coppice was one long roar  the great boughs swaying  creaking  and complaining bitterly  very glad we were  when night fell  to snuggle all four close together in the hollow in the beech hole which mother had selected as our abode after the destruction of our second nest  it was a very convenient residence  considering that it was a ready made one  some winter storm of years long past had torn away a large branch at its junction with the trunk  and rain and weather had rotted the scar till at last a hollow was left large enough to hold a dozen of us  once it had been full of water  but a green woodpecker boring its nest in the trunk below  the moisture had drained away through the rotten fibres  and now it was dry as a bone  and formed as convenient and comfortable a retreat as any dreyless family of squirrels could possibly desire   the gale lasted two whole days and nights  and then it cleared and left a hard blue sky from which the small white flecks of wind cloud vanished one by one  and on the fourth morning we woke to find the grass white with hoar frost and a keen tang in the air which filled us with a wild delight in the mere fact of being alive  rusty  hazel and i sallied forth and tore round and round like three mad things  flinging ourselves from bough to bough  rattling up and down the huge trunk and wide spreading branches  playing all manner of practical jokes on one another   mother watched us indulgently  but when  quite out of breath  we at last came back to her  she announced that the time had arrived to begin the collection of our winter stores   ‘now that you have no father   she said  ‘you must help me in the work  for remember there is nothing worse than to be caught by bad weather unprepared  and without many stores of food    that was the first real work that i ever did  it seemed odd  when we reached the nut bushes at the edge of the coppice  not to choose the plumpest nuts  and sit and eat them on the spot  i think  indeed  that we all began by doing so  and mother did not interfere until we had each had a good breakfast  but afterwards she kept us steadily to work  i am afraid that we needed a good deal of superintendence to keep us up to the mark  but mother set us such a good example that we were shamed into doing our best  at first i was under the impression that we were to carry all the nuts back to our beech tree home  but mother laughed when i suggested this  and told me that it was quite unnecessary to do anything of the kind  after looking about a little  she chose a long hollow under a gnarled old blackthorn trunk at the bottom of the hedge  and here  and in other similar cavities  we stored a goodly supply  towards noon mother told us that that was enough for the day  and while she and hazel went back home  rusty and i decided to go for a little round on our own account   working down the hedge  we came upon a patch of thick brambles from which the blackberries were falling from over ripeness  a greedy cock pheasant below was simply stuffing himself with the fallen berries and those near the ground  for a joke rusty crept up quietly  and then  making a sudden bound  alighted almost on the handsome bird s head  off he went with a terrific whirr and flutter across the big meadow  and rusty  with a malicious gleam in his eyes  sprang back to my side   presently we found ourselves at the coppice gate  and instinctively i stopped and gazed across the meadow towards the hall  the wind had brought many leaves down  and the long  low  red brick building with its steep tiled roofs  stood strongly outlined behind the thinning fringe of its oaks and elms   i don t know whether it was the keen  brisk air  or what  but suddenly the idea came to me to visit the old place once more  and on the spur of the moment i suggested it to rusty   for a moment my brother looked blank  adventurous as he was  the idea of crossing more than a quarter of a mile of open grass land rather staggered him  you know we squirrels will make journeys of any length provided we can travel through the tree tops  and so long as a tree is handy we have no objection to short trips across country from one to another  but none of us care about open ground  we can run at a good speed for a short distance  but there is no cover in grass  there we are absolutely at the mercy of any hungry hawk  while weasels have a nasty trick of popping out suddenly from rabbit earths or drains  then  too  there is no escape from the gun or rabbit rifle of any pot hunting man or boy  while poaching dogs or cats are another source of really desperate peril   however  rusty was not the sort to think twice of danger  or to be outdared by the brother whom he had secretly despised as a ‘tame  squirrel  i saw his teeth set and a sudden sparkle in his eye   ‘all right   he remarked  and that was all  he was out of the hedge and over the ditch before me  and leading the way at a great pace across the pasture   we did not keep to the path  but made off to the left  where an irregular fringe of trees grew along inside the hedge which cut off the pasture from the road leading between the hall and the village  great luck attended us  beyond a few rabbits we saw no sign of life  and when we got close enough to the trees to take refuge if any danger approached i breathed more freely  and i feel sure that rusty was equally relieved  racing along among the rustling dead leaves  we crossed the brook near the culvert under the road  the rivulet was so small that it was no trouble to jump  then we found ourselves in the park  and here we had to take to the open again  the fine clumps of timber which dotted it here and there were our islands of refuge  and we ran from one to the other  the same good fortune attending us during our whole journey  from the last tree we steered for the kitchen garden wall  and keeping along the bottom of this  reached the sunk fence  once up this  and i was on familiar ground   a long narrow plantation of kentish cob nuts bordered the wall which divided the kitchen garden from the lawns  and in this we were soon snugly ensconced   ‘my teeth  did you ever see such nuts   exclaimed rusty  staring in wide eyed amazement at the great russet coloured cobs which hung in profusion among the brilliantly tinted leaves   ‘oh yes  i ve eaten lots of them   replied i  with conscious superiority  ‘try them  they re uncommon good    rusty needed no second bidding  but set to work  and cutting the tip off one of the largest nuts  was soon discussing its fat  white kernel with a gusto which proved that he thoroughly agreed with me in my estimate of the quality of cobs  i joined in  and we made a most delicious luncheon  from where we sat the lawn and part of the house were in full sight  and all the time i kept a watch fill eye upon the clump of evergreens where i had been used to play  in the hope that i might see the familiar figure of my dear master in his rough tweeds  and his cap on the back of his head  sauntering across the lawn   alas  there was no sign of him nor of any of the fortescues  had i known it  half the length of england separated me from the nearest of my old friends  after a time  however  some one did stroll out upon the terrace walk  he was a complete stranger—a short  fat man  with red cheeks and mutton chop whiskers  he wore a grey bowler  tipped far back upon his head  his thumbs were stuck in the armholes of his gaudy waistcoat  and a long  black cigar was held between his thick lips  he was gazing round him with a complacent air of proprietorship which in some indefinable fashion annoyed me intensely   suddenly he took the cigar from his lips and shouted loudly  ‘simpson   a man with a bill hook in his hand came hurrying round from the shrubbery behind the house   the stout man pointed to jack s and my pet clump of evergreens  ‘those shrubs are untidy  simpson  they want clipping up  get to work on  em at once   and  to my horror and disgust  simpson began chopping and carving away at the deodars and arbor vitæ  lopping all the boughs up a man s height from the ground  and turning the pretty shrubs into the stiff  unnatural likeness of the toy trees in jack s youngest brother s noah s ark   then  as i looked about me  i began to see that many things had been changed  the laurels were cut close and flat  a number of fine limbs had been sawn from the elms  several new beds of weird pattern had been cut in the splendid century old turf of the lawn  the gravel paths were all fresh swept  everything had a painfully overtidy appearance   presently one of the drawing room french windows was pushed open  and a third person appeared on the scene—a boy about jack s age  but how strangely different  he was short  like the elder man  and had the appearance of having but just stepped out of a band box  his cord riding breeches were as immaculate as his white cuffs and tall white collar  his brown boots quite gleamed in the autumn sun  and he wore new dogskin gloves  strolling over towards his father  he began to talk  but we were too far away to hear what they said  after a short time they both turned and came across the lawn towards the kitchen garden door   ‘i say  scud  hadn t we better hook it   suggested rusty  but i was so interested in these new people  who seemed to have usurped the place of my dear fortescues  that foolishly i replied   ‘no  they re not coming near us  keep still  and they ll never see us    the pair had nearly reached the garden door when i heard the boy exclaim something  and they changed the direction of their walk in the direction of the hazels  a swish of bent branches shortly followed   the distance from the garden door down to the angle of the garden wall was not more than thirty yards  and i knew very well that  thick as the bushes were  there was not a ghost of a chance of our remaining undetected if they came poking about in this fashion   ‘come on  rusty   i muttered  and we at once made off as quietly as we could  unluckily for us  while the stout man was poking his head among the branches  puffing and blowing as he did so like a broken winded horse  the boy had walked on down the path  and next moment his shrill voice rang out   ‘i say  father  here are two beastly squirrels stealing nuts  keep an eye on  em while i get my gun    he was off across the grass at a pace one would not have credited him with  and we  aware that any attempt at further concealment was useless  went off also at top speed   what we both dreaded was the long open space at the bottom of the kitchen garden wall  where it abutted on the park  however  there was no shirking it  if we stayed where we were we would be caught like rats in a trap  it was rusty who made the jump first out of the bushes and down the sunk fence  and as i followed him i heard the fat man shouting hoarsely  ‘quick  they re running away    how we scuttled  even a terrier would have had his work cut out to catch us  there was no cover at all until we reached the far end of the long line of wall  and we strained every nerve to gain the hedge which ran at right angles from the end of it  separating the park from the road  the distance was not much more than seventy yards  but it seemed like a mile as we tore along  fresh shouts behind us spurred us to almost super squirrel efforts  hardly five yards were left when suddenly—bang  and a sound like hail pattering on the ground behind us  next second  and with simultaneous bounds we were in the hedge  but before we could get through it and into shelter on the far side the sound of another shot rang through the calm autumn air  and this time with better aim  leaves flew in the hedge  and a sharp blow on the head sent me staggering  nearly causing me to lose my foothold   ‘come on  scud  we must cross the road   called rusty at that moment  and with a fine jump he was across the ditch and out on the white  dusty surface   recovering myself  i followed  and found that  though my head was singing  i could still run as well as ever   luckily there was not a soul in sight  so we crossed the road in safety  plunged through the opposite hedge  and found ourselves in a plantation of young larches about twenty feet high  through these we went as hard as ever we could pelt  until  quite exhausted  we came to rest somewhere in the thickest depths  and  climbing into one of the largest trees  lay panting and tired out on an upper bough  for a minute neither of us could move  then suddenly rusty  glancing at me  exclaimed   ‘why  scud  you re hurt    ‘yes  something hit me   i answered faintly   in a moment the good fellow was licking my wounded head  a pellet of shot  it seemed  had glanced along my skull  cutting the skin and going right through one of my ears  the wound bled a good deal  but it was not a serious one  and after i had got my breath back  and after my heart had ceased thumping as though it would burst  i felt very little the worse  and announced that i was quite ready to start home  but rusty  more cautious  refused to move   ‘that fellow with the gun may be waiting in the road for us   he said  ‘much better stay here a bit  the shadows are still short  and we shall have plenty of light for our journey home    his advice seemed good  so we waited where we were for an hour or more  my wound stopped bleeding  but my head was very sore  it was not  however  so badly hurt as my feelings  that i should have been shot at and nearly killed in the garden of the hall seemed beyond belief  and what made it worse was that i had impressed on rusty over and over again that whatever the dangers in our coppice  the hall grounds  at any rate  were a safe refuge  one thing i was deeply grateful for—that he had not been harmed  with all the intensity of my squirrel nature i hated the intruders who had put the insult upon me  how i longed that jack might have been there to take vengeance on our persecutors    illustration  climbing into one of the largest trees  we lay panting and tired out    rusty  good fellow that he was  forebore to add to my self reproaches by any remarks about what had happened  when i made some sort of apology for bringing him into trouble  he merely smiled  and  licking his lips  said   ‘i shan t forget those nuts in a hurry  wouldn t mother like a few of them    at last  when the shadows were beginning to lengthen towards the east  we made a move  under rusty s direction we worked back very quietly through the plantation to the edge of the road  and took a careful survey from the top of the tallest tree  all was still  the only sounds that broke the quiet of the windless autumn afternoon being the scrape of simpson s saw as he lopped away branches from the hall trees  and the distant ‘gee   and ‘haw   of a ploughman at work in a field to the right of the larch plantation   we crossed the road again  and resolved that though the distance was considerably greater  we would stick to the hedge all the way  and not trust ourselves again to the open grass  fortunately for our peace of mind  the road along the side of which we were forced to travel was quite deserted  and  keeping as much as possible in the centre of the hedge  we slipped along at best pace  of course  it was not by any means easy travelling  for in places the quickset was so thick and close that we were forced to take to the ground for short distances  ground near a hedge is always most dangerous  for an old hedgerow  especially one with high banks either of earth or stone  is the chosen home of the stoat and the weasel  and both these bloodthirsty little terrors are quite as much at home among the branches of a thick hedge as even a squirrel   more than half of our journey was covered in safety  and when we reached and crossed the brook we began to feel as though we were almost home  but we were not to escape without further adventure  a little way past the brook  just as we were nearing the timber which i have mentioned as running in an irregular row along the inside of this part of the hedge  there came a piece of holly so thick and close cropped as to be quite impenetrable except very close to the ground  it would really have been wiser to have cut out across the field to the nearest of the trees  but we had had such a scare that we shirked the open  rusty  leading as before  had got half way through the holly  when i saw him stop short  and then  with a little warning cry  make a quick bound upwards into the thickest heart of the holly  at the same moment the tangled ivy which covered the bank below became alive with little beady eyes and snake like  sinuous forms  we had run right into a whole pack of weasels hunting together  as is their custom on autumn afternoons   i was after him like a flash  but the brutes had seen us  and came swarming up the close set stems  hard at our heels  under ordinary circumstances we could have cleared them in half a dozen bounds  but here we were at a shocking disadvantage  above our heads the holly was like a wall  and it was all we could do to force our way through the stiff  glistening  dark green leaves  i remember plunging along desperately  almost mad with fright  my eyes half shut to protect them from the sharp prickles  and my nostrils full of the horrible  musky odour of our eager pursuers   then suddenly i was out of the darkness and on the top of the hedge  scratched  breathless  my wounded ear bleeding again  but where was rusty  i could not see him  and a horrible fear almost numbed me  just in front the branches were shaking  but it was too thick to see what was happening below  anxiety overcoming terror  i made a dive forward into the tangle from which i had just escaped with much difficulty  and almost as i did so there came rusty s head out of the thicket  his eyes were bright with fright  and he dragged himself forward slowly  as if something were pulling him back  instantly i saw that a weasel had him by the tail  its sharp teeth buried in the thick  long hairs  without thinking twice  i plunged down and snapped with all my might at the fierce brute s head  my long front teeth sank deep into the back of his neck  and i felt them grate on his skull  his jaws opened and he fell backwards  knocking over the next of the pack in his fall   relieved of the weight  rusty shot upwards  and with half a dozen tremendous bounds was out of danger  as i followed him  a third weasel gained the top of the hedge  and  throwing its long body high into the air  like a snake in the act of striking  tried its best to seize me  i heard its needle like  white teeth snap and caught a glimpse of its red eyes gleaming fiercely  but i was too quick for it  and  as it fell back disappointed  i was off in rusty s wake at a speed that defied pursuit  regardless of concealment  we tore along the top of the hedge until level with the trees  then  turning off to the left  reached the timber  and so from tree to tree towards the coppice   the sun was just setting when two worn out  scratched  frightened  and very disreputable looking squirrels reached the old beech and made humble confession to their mother of all that had happened to them during that adventurous day  and  after a thorough good scolding  were at last forgiven and permitted to sup on beech mast and curl up with the rest of their family snug in the heart of the great beech trunk   after this day i found that rusty treated me with far more consideration than he had ever shown before  he dropped his jeers about ‘tame  squirrels  and showed in his silent way that he was pleased to have my company in his wanderings abroad  i forgot to say that  though his brush looked a little lopsided for a time  the hair soon grew again  while my wound healed rapidly  but i still have a small hole through the left ear where the shot passed  to remind me of my narrow escape   for the next few weeks mother kept us very busy  helping her to collect winter stores  these consisted almost entirely of hazel nuts  acorns  and beech mast  all of which were very plentiful  we made small hoards in many different places  a very necessary precaution  for if—to use jack s expression—we were to put all our eggs in one basket  we should stand a very good chance of starving in hard weather  there are plenty of thieves in the woods  rats and mice are the worst—absolutely conscienceless  both of them  then there are the nut hatches  who have a wonderful trick of ferreting out nuts hidden in holes in timber  again  snow may cover a ground hoard too deep to reach it  or even hide it altogether  so that it is impossible to find it at all  people who abuse us  because we occasionally do a little pruning among the tips of the evergreens  should remember that we are the greatest planters in the country  i suppose that quite one in three of the ancient oaks that england is so proud of have sprung from acorns hidden by squirrels in autumn  and either lost or not needed during the winter  so  too  have countless beech trees and nut bushes  and not a few pines and firs into the bargain   as we worked at our stores we often met others of our race intent upon similar business  the nuts of our coppice were famous for a long way round  and were so plentiful that there was enough for fifty families if they cared to come for them  we enjoyed seeing these visitors  and had great games with them   and so day by day  as the leaves fell and the night frosts became more frequent and more sharp  we worked and played and generally enjoyed life quite undisturbed by any outside interference      chapter vii  the grey terror   gales and cold rain prevailing  we spent much of our time indoors  while the wind roared through the coppice  and clouds of dead leaves whirled through the air  settling in rustling drifts in every hollow  the bracken was long ago brown and dead  but the blackberry leaves  though purpled by the frost  still clung with their accustomed obstinacy to the stalks  and provided thick cover for the pheasants  the old beech trees were nearly bare  and  indeed  all the trees except the evergreens  especially those on the west side of the wood  had lost their leaves  only the oaks had foliage still to boast of  and most of this was brown and withered   but it was only november  and we young ones had as yet no idea of retiring for the winter  on fine days  especially when frost was in the air  we were as frisky as ever  and had magnificent games among the heaps of dead leaves  it was the greatest fun possible to take running headers from the long  bare tips of the beech boughs  falling on the soft  elastic cushion of leaves  in which one completely disappeared  just as a water rat does in a pond  under the leaves the ground was still thick with ripe beech mast  so there was no need as yet to infringe upon our winter stores  there were pine cones  too  by way of change  and fallen hazel nuts  though these were getting scarce now that not only we but our distant cousins  the dormice  had been getting in winter stores   our own preparations for winter were quite complete  the last piece of work had been to line our home thoroughly with dry moss  and partially to stop up the entrance which had been so large that  when the wind blew that way  it made cold draughts whistle round inside  for this work we young ones collected the material while mother did the building  and rusty and i gathered useful hints for the future   all these days  when the air was still  or the wind blew from the direction of the hall  we could hear in the distance the clink  clink of axes—a novel sound in this country side  where the squire and his forebears before him had had the true englishman s love of timber  and thought not twice but many times before cutting down a single tree  but for a long time our solitude was not invaded  except by a few school children picking late blackberries or nuts  or a labourer returning from his work along the wood path  then  one fine morning early in november  when rusty and i were having our usual morning scramble  the sharp report of a gun sent us skurrying to the nearest refuge  which happened to be a tall fir tree not far from the coppice gate  bang again —this time closer  rusty looked out but dodged back with great rapidity  he intimated to me that the young murderer from the hall had appeared and that he  rusty  didn t mean to move until he disappeared   bang again  a cock pheasant came whirring up past us  rocketing high over the tops of the trees  and a second dose of shot  hopelessly too late  sent a shower of twigs scattering from the tree just over our heads  and made us cower the closer against the trunk   steps came trampling past beneath us  and the firing became fast and furious  every living thing took cover  or  if it had wings  departed as fast as they would carry it  the racket did not last long  and  as we found out later  the bag was not a large one  the hall s new tenants were not good shots  and their new keeper  who had supplanted old crump  did not know his business  as soon as the noise had died away we made the best of our way home  and found mother and hazel  who had been lying close at home  extremely relieved to see us safe back once more   several times again before the winter the solitude of our coppice was invaded by the same party—the little stout man with the mutton chop whiskers  his white collared  pasty faced son  and a tall keeper with a ginger beard  but after their first two visits none of the coppice people paid much attention to them beyond sitting tight in cover  the very pheasants—stupid fellows as they are—made jeering remarks about their inability to kill anything unless it happened to be fool enough to sit still to be fired at   what did cause much more serious alarm was the rumour of a new and most dangerous enemy  the news came to us through a strange squirrel whom rusty and i met one cold bright morning rummaging among the deep beech leaves for a breakfast of mast  the poor fellow had a nasty wound at the back of his neck  and looked thin and miserable  he was so nervous that when he heard us coming he bolted wildly up a tree  we called to him  and  looking rather ashamed of himself  he came back and met us   ‘what s up   inquired i  ‘we re not going to eat you  come down and finish your breakfast    ‘ugh  don t talk of eating   he answered in trembling tones  ‘you wouldn t if you d been so nearly eaten as i was three days ago   and he showed us his wound   ‘weasel   rusty asked   ‘no—much worse    ‘what  not a fox    ‘i m not quite fool enough to sit on the ground and let a fox catch me   retorted the stranger  ‘it was a wild cat    ‘wild cat   exclaimed i  ‘why  i d no idea there were any left in these parts    ‘no more had i   put in rusty  ‘mother says that a very old squirrel once told her that his father had seen a wild cat  but that s ever so many years ago  there are none left now    ‘none left   returned the other angrily  ‘very well  all i say is  wait  your turn will come    he was clearing out in a huff when i stopped him   ‘wait a minute  i want to hear all about it  anyone can see you ve been badly mauled  come with us up into our beech tree  and i ll find you a better breakfast than this half rotten stuff  then you can tell us all about it    after a little more persuasion  he cooled down and accompanied us  and we all heard his story  it appeared that a week before he and one of his brothers had visited a spanish chestnut they knew of at some distance from their home  which was in a large wood about a mile away  when  without the slightest warning  a great cat had sprung out of a patch of dead bracken close by  and with two quick swings of her terrible paws bowled them both over  our new acquaintance owed his life to the fact that he had seen the enemy coming just in time to duck  and  consequently  had received the full force of the blow upon his neck instead of his head  but even so he had been stunned  and had recovered his senses only in time to see the savage beast running rapidly away among the underbrush with the dead body of his brother swinging limp between her powerful jaws  knowing that she would come back for him  he had summoned all his remaining energies  and succeeded in climbing into a pollard oak and hiding in a knot hole in its spreading top  from there he watched the robber return  moving noiselessly across the dead grass and leaves on velvet cushioned paws  noted the grey coat  stiff and coarse  the short tail  broad head  and small  close rounded ears  had seen her search snuffing among the dead leaves  moving round and round in impatient circles  and shivered in his terror  but fortune was good to him  for after a time  which seemed endless  the cat  tired of her vain search  had at last turned  and with tail straight up padded softly back the way she had come  but it was not until nearly sunset that the wounded squirrel had made shift to crawl home  sore and aching  and there he had lain for two whole days  alas  the tale of his sorrows was not yet told  on the third day his mother went out about midday to bring in some food  and never came back  towards evening his father had gone to search for her  and returned at dark with the terrible tidings that the same stealthy fiend had captured her too  he had found some gnawed bones and her brush—that was all   by this time the whole wood was in a state of panic  rabbits  pheasants  and squirrels  all had suffered alike  the cat  it was said  was only one of a family who had taken up their abode in an immense hollow hornbeam in the centre of the wood  a regular reign of terror set in  and our new friend  whose name was cob  together with his father and his sister  the only survivors of the family  had decided to emigrate before worse happened   we were all very sorry for the unfortunates  a worse time for squirrels to emigrate could hardly be imagined  for  of course  they had been forced to abandon all their winter stores and their nest  which had been strengthened against the cold weather  it was now too late in the season to collect a proper provision  and they stood a very good chance of starving if the winter should turn out a severe one  you will understand that we young ones  who had never yet been through a winter  were not able to realize quite how serious the misfortune was  but mother  who had seen the snows of three years  thoroughly comprehended the situation  and at once bade rusty and myself do all we could to assist the unlucky family  next morning we paid a visit to their temporary quarters  a large untidy hole in a hollow oak  and after first showing them where the last few nuts were to be found in the ditch below the hazel bushes  set to work to discover better quarters for them  of course  by this time we knew our coppice from end to end  there was not a tree we were not familiar with from root to topmost branch  but after a good deal of consideration and discussion  we decided that the best refuge was another hole lower down in our own tree  it was one that mother had thought of seriously  after father s death  as a residence for ourselves  but had decided against as being rather too small  however  we found on making a thorough examination that the wood on one side of it was so rotten that it could easily be dug out  and then the hollow would be amply large enough to accommodate the three wanderers  they  on their part  were devoutly grateful for the trouble we had taken on their behalf  and thanked us most cordially  cob s sister  whose name was sable  a little  dark furred creature  quite touched me by her shyly expressed gratitude   autumn was now far advanced  and we had had several very sharp frosts  except for the oaks  to which their dead  dry leaves still clung  the trees were bare  rusty and i took our morning exercise among the denser foliage of the evergreen firs and larches  of which there were fortunately a good number in our coppice  i say fortunately because  where these trees are handy a squirrel need never starve even in the hardest weather  not that squirrels are given to starving  unless owing to some quite unforeseen and unusual accident we are as well able to fend for ourselves even in the hardest winters as any inhabitants of the woodland   the migrant birds had all left long ago  and the woods were quieter than of old  not that there was not plenty of life remaining  the wood pigeons still pecked among the beech leaves for mast  great tits and tomtits moved restlessly among the branches of our beech  flights of long tail tits talked softly in the tops of the evergreens  finches of many kinds—greenfinch  chaffinch  bullfinch  and even a few hawfinches  feasted on the hawthorn berries which hung thickly on the bare hedges  and began to take their toll of the fast reddening holly  the privet and mountain ash berries were gone long ago  these form the pet dessert of bird life  and are always cleaned up almost before they are ripe  so  too  was the sticky scarlet fruit of three gnarled old yews which stood in a little group all by themselves just beyond the rabbit warren where the ground sloped towards the brook  thrushes and blackbirds still visited their  dark recesses  but more from habit than for any other reason   redwings and fieldfares fed in small flocks across the open ground  and shared with the starlings and rooks the insect food of which they are so fond  the grass  no longer green but browned at the tips by frost and sodden from lack of sun  had ceased to grow  and feed was becoming short  i noticed that the cattle had taken to the higher ground instead of feeding along the brook  and that in the mornings when the frost dew hung thick on the meadows  they wandered along the hedgerows  picking drier mouthfuls from the bank   some of our acquaintances had already retired for the winter  the hedgehogs were no longer to be seen making leisurely progress along the hedge banks  they had all gone to sleep deep in leaf lined crevices under the blackthorn roots  the dormice had followed their example  and curled themselves up for the winter in their delicately woven globes of grass and fibre  mr  dormouse is a heavier sleeper than we are  yet not above rousing for a square meal if the sun comes out warm and bright on a january morning  snakes  slow worms and lizards had all disappeared long ago  and would not move again for more than four months  i had not seen a bat for a fortnight  and i fancy the last of them had joined his comrades hung up in the church tower or in farmer martin s thatched barn  stiff and motionless like dead game in the hall larder   field mice showed when the sun came out  dodging about on the surface of the dead leaves  apparently very busy  and yet never appearing to accomplish anything in particular  but they would soon follow most of the four legged denizens of the coppice into winter quarters  and leave the bare woods to the birds  the rabbits  and the cunning  hungry fox   of the wild cat  the terror of the neighbouring wood  we heard nothing at all  and though i often talked of her with cob and his sister  we did not imagine that there was much chance of her raiding so far from home  cob gradually recovered from his wound  and  as food was still fairly plentiful  he grew fat and strong again   nothing occurred to disturb the even tenor of those last few days before winter set in in earnest  and the silence that reigned in the coppice was broken only by the cheery song of the robin  the low twitter of the tits  and occasionally the clear pipe of the missel thrush  then came a day when the wind turned to the north east  and a new biting  penetrating chill filled the bleak air   for the first time in my experience mother absolutely refused to leave the nest   ‘children   she said drowsily  ‘it s going to snow  i feel it in my bones  close the door with moss and let us sleep    pushing a bunch of moss into the opening  she curled herself into the deepest  darkest corner of our snug retreat  and almost instantly fell into a sleep deeper than ever we had seen or dreamed of  squirrels  you must know  are never still for more than a few minutes at a time in their ordinary sleep  i know that  whenever i wake at night  and that is very often  especially now that i am no longer young  some of my family are always moving their legs  twitching about like a dog that lies before the fire and hunts rabbits in its dreams  but this was a different thing  this sleep of mother s—she lay like a dead thing on her side  her splendid brush curled round and over her  and  as we watched  her breathing seemed to slow until it became almost imperceptible   we  too  felt strangely drowsy  but yet  with all the curiosity of youth  would not yield to it  so anxious were we to see this snow of which we had heard so often  the wind whistled in stronger and stronger gusts  making weird wailing sounds among the bare branches  the sky  already one uniform mass of greyish cloud  grew duller and thicker  while up to windward a darkness like that of the winter twilight began to cover the land  rusty and i  peering out through a small hole in the moss  saw the great trees bending and swaying in the increasing blast  while the dead leaves raised by the wind rustled and rattled in brown clouds along the ground below  then suddenly  and as if by magic  the whole air was swarming with little white atoms  which whirled and fluttered silently in a mad dance  thicker and thicker they came till the sky was blotted out  and even the trees close by were nearly hidden behind the waving white veil  all along the eastern edges of the beech tree limbs lines of pure white appeared and grew  while the dry leaves below stopped their rustling as they vanished  hidden beneath a carpet whiter than fallen hawthorn petals  to us  who had never seen the like before  it was a wonderful sight  and we gazed and gazed as if we should never tire  but gradually the drowsiness of the snow sleep came upon us and mastered us  and  whether we would or no  closed our eyes  rusty slipped limply back  and lay like a dead thing beside the quiet forms of hazel and my mother  i remember vaguely pushing back the plug of moss into position  and then i  too  fell back and sank away into a long  delicious  dreamless slumber                                             it may have been a day  or a week  or  for all i know  a month before i woke again  my sleep had been so deep that for a full minute i was quite unable to realize where i was or what had happened  and i lay contentedly still in that pleasant  dreamy state between sleep and wakefulness  then my eye was caught by a tiny brilliant sunbeam  which  striking through some minute interstice in the mossy door  made a little path of golden light in which little motes of dust danced gaily across our hollow retreat   slowly recollection returned  and with it a feeling of perfectly ravenous hunger  struggling up out of the deep hollow in my mossy bed into which i had sunk  i stretched  yawned  and  looking round  saw rusty with one eye open gazing at me with a drowsy  puzzled expression  mother and hazel were still wrapped in deepest sleep   i barked to wake rusty  but he only blinked at me without speaking  until at last i leant over and nipped his ear  that woke him   ‘weasel take you  scud   he growled  starting up  ‘your teeth are sharp    i told him i was simply starving   ‘come to think of it  so am i   he said  stretching and yawning in his turn  ‘let s go and get some grub    ‘hadn t we better wake mother and hazel   i suggested  but rusty thought not  since they were so sound asleep  standing up on my hind legs  i pulled away the plug of moss that closed the entrance  and sprang out  with rusty close at my heels  what a sight met our eyes  even hunger was forgotten in amazement  the rays of the morning sun shining from a sky of clearest  palest blue were reflected back from one universal dazzle of white  below us the ground was an even plain of snow  which had covered up and hidden grass  dead fern  fallen branches  ant and mole heaps—all the irregularities to which our eyes were accustomed—under its deep smooth carpet  from the bare branches of the beeches and oaks the snow had melted and fallen away  but the evergreen boughs still bent under heavy loads  from which in places long  transparent icicles drooped  it was freezing hard  for the surface of the snow sparkled with crystals of ice  which shone more brilliantly even than dewdrops in the slanting rays  no breath of air stirred under the cloudless heavens  and the wood had a new stillness which was almost awe inspiring   but  oh  the air  cold as it was  it had a dry tingle which set the blood fairly racing in our veins  and every moment increased our already ravenous hunger  recovering from our amazement at the strange novelty of all around us  we bounded off together  intent on a store of beech mast which lay beneath a twisted root of our own old beech   it was a queer sensation  that first landing upon the snow  so hard frozen was it that our light weights made no impression upon it whatsoever  you would have needed the skill of a fox to find our tracks  rusty was the first to reach the spot where we had made our store   ‘snakes  eyes and adders  tongues   he exclaimed—rusty was sadly given to the use of bad language—‘this white stuff has covered it all up  and i m hungry enough to eat a sprouting acorn    ‘dig  you duffer   i answered him  and together we set to work  our sharp claws sending the crisp snow flying in clouds behind us  suddenly the crust gave way  and we both tumbled through  one on top of the other  into a good sized hollow beneath  at first rusty was much annoyed  considering it all my fault  however  as soon as he discovered that we were actually on top of our larder  he recovered  and began with all speed to scratch out the mast from the nooks and corners in which it had been stored   some people will tell you that a squirrel never hides two nuts in the same place  but this is not quite the fact  as i have said before  we all have a very natural objection to piling a whole score of nuts or other provender together in one place  for then  if any marauder does come along  he naturally gets the whole lot  but it must not be imagined that a separate hiding place is made for each single nut or acorn  no  when we discover a good place for a larder  such as the hollow i am now speaking of  we often put quite a quantity of food into it  poking each separate morsel into a different crack or corner   that was a royal feast  i am quite certain that neither rusty nor i had ever been so hungry before in the whole of our short lives  and this makes me suspect that we had been asleep for at least a fortnight  or possibly more  at last rusty  after a vain rummage in the furthest corner of the hollow  turned on me   ‘you greedy pig  scud  you ve eaten the last bit of mast    ‘well  you are a good one   i retorted  laughing  ‘i don t mind betting you a chestnut that you ve eaten more than me    ‘anyhow  there s nothing left here   replied rusty in a very aggrieved tone  ‘at this rate our stores won t last long    ‘there is any amount left   i told him  ‘and it seems to me that travelling is safer and better than ever  we ll go round and hunt up some of those hazel nuts under the hedge next time    ‘all very well if this weather lasts   grumbled my brother  who always loved a grievance  ‘but suppose it melts  mother said it often did  then the grass will be all wet and beastly  and the ditch probably full of water  or suppose more snow falls  then everything will be covered up    ‘ pon my fur  you re as bad as a frog   i retorted  ‘never was such a squirrel to croak  come along out of this dark hole  i want some exercise    as we crawled out a bark hailed us from above  and there was cob sitting out on a low branch over our heads   ‘i say  you fellows   he cried  ‘this is jolly  isn t it   ‘ripping   i answered  ‘have you had a feed    ‘yes  i ve had some mast  but we haven t much  so i thought of going over to the fir trees and looking for some cones    ‘right you are  we ll come too  i m still hungry enough to eat the most turpentiny cone in the coppice    so the three of us scuttled off across the crisp surface  and after satisfying ourselves with pine kernels and a little of the inner bark from the branch tips by way of dessert  proceeded to rouse the wood with a thorough good scamper  we had the whole place quite to ourselves except for the birds  the wood pigeons seemed as cheerful as usual  and the tits were busy pecking along the branches  but i must say i felt sorry for the robins  the thrushes  and blackbirds  and most of the other feathered creatures  the poor things seemed to have no life left in them  they sat huddled up in the sunshine with their feathers all fluffed out  till they looked twice as big as usual  but evidently they were all pretty hungry  birds  you know  do not suffer much from cold directly  but when there is hard frost  and especially when frozen snow covers the ground  they have to go on very short commons  those that feed on the grubs that live in tree trunks do well enough  and  of course  the sparrows and finches visit the rick and farm yards  and so provide for themselves  it is the berry and worm eating birds who are worst off in weather of this kind  the hips and haws do not last long  and in really severe frost the holly berries also disappear  leaving only such untempting food as the hard dark ivy berries  worse than all is the lack of water  and i fancy as many birds perish from thirst during a long frost as from all other causes put together   when the low sun began to drop towards the west the cold increased  and we three hurried home and went to sleep again  but a day or two later the same brilliant sun called us again  and this time we resolved to pay our promised visit to the hedge by the hazel bushes  where we had buried the first of our nuts  at our special request cob accompanied us  he  good fellow  as i discovered  was half starving himself  in order to keep a supply for his sister and father  in case they woke up  so i consulted rusty  and we agreed that we would take him with us and stand him a good feed out of our nut store   when we reached the place  we found  much to our disgust  that the ditch was quite full of snow  which had drifted in from the field  there was nothing for it but to begin a regular quarrying job  and very hard work we found it  cob worked like a mole  and but for his useful assistance we should hardly have succeeded in reaching the treasure stored beneath the old thorn stump  as it was  we must have been digging fully two hours before we at last hit upon the right spot  and what with the keen air and the hard work we were pretty sharp set by the time the plump brown beauties were unearthed   ‘great water rats   exclaimed rusty  driving his strong front teeth through the glossy shell of his first nut  and jerking away the pieces with quick  hungry tugs  ‘this is fine  all the sun and none of the wind  just the place for a good feed and a rest    ‘all the same  i hate being on the ground   said cob  uneasily glancing round at the steep walls of snow which surrounded the little white pit which we had dug  and at the bottom of which we sat feasting   rusty uttered a disdainful snort   ‘what s to hurt us here  a weasel wouldn t trust himself in this dazzle of snow  and foxes don t prowl in the daytime  let alone in a sun like this    ‘oh  i know it s foolish   answered cob humbly  ‘but i ve been that way ever since the time that i had that escape from——   his voice died away in a sharp choking gasp  looking round in some surprise  i saw him staring upwards  a frozen horror in his wide eyes  following his glance  i saw glaring down upon us through the hedge two cruel green orbs set in a wide grey face  it did not need the short ears  the stiff whiskers  or the rows of sharp white teeth  bared in a hungry grin  to tell me that i was looking upon the terror of the woods  the wild cat of merton spinney   the awful head was hardly a yard away  its owner had crawled up unseen on the far side of the hedge—that is  inside the coppice  for we were in the ditch outside—and having got wind of us  was endeavouring to creep through unseen and unheard  so as to pounce upon us unawares  it was the lucky chance of our having cob with us  whose hearing was acute beyond either rusty s or my own  that gave us that needful second s warning  without it there is no possible doubt but that i should never have been alive to tell this story   one often says ‘quick as a cat   but it would be just as correct or more so to say ‘quick as a squirrel   and i am quite certain that hardly half a second elapsed between the moment i set eyes on the cat s head emerging from the briers and the bound which landed me six feet out of the hole along the ditch to the left  with the best intentions in the world no one of us could have helped the others  but would only have sacrificed his life uselessly if he had tried to  thinking over the matter since  i have often wondered why the cat did not pounce straight upon cob  who has confessed that he was so badly frightened that he never jumped until both rusty and i were clear out of the hole  the fact remains that she did not do so  a rustle of quickly moved branches  and then a series of soft  padding sounds behind me  proved that i had been selected as her dinner—an attention which  as you may imagine  i could very well have dispensed with    illustration  two cruel green orbs set in a wide grey face    i was badly frightened—there is no use denying it—but i did succeed in keeping my wits about me  in the open  of course  i was no match for her  her springs were of tremendous length  far greater than mine  for a cat—like all her tribe—can travel at tremendous speed for a short distance  aware of this  i turned sharp back through the hedge to my right—only just in time  for her cruel teeth snapped not an inch from my brush as i dived through the heart of the hedge  being smaller than she  i gained a few yards in the passage through the close set branches  and tore off across the frozen snow at top speed towards the nearest tree  there was no time to pick or choose  i had to take the first that came  and here luck was against me  for it was a tall but slender birch which happened to stand some little distance apart  the nearest tree to it being a beech some fifty feet away   up i went with a rush  again missing death by a sort of miracle  for my enemy launched herself at me like a shot from a catapult  striking the bark not the length of my body below my brush  she clung there a moment  and then fell back with a baffled snarl  and for a moment i thought she had given it up  but i suppose she was very hungry  or perhaps too enraged at her first failure to abandon the chase  for the next moment she drew off a few yards  and  coming at the tree with a rush  clattered up it  her sharp talons ringing against the rough bark   naturally my first impulse was to run out towards the beech and jump into it  could i have done this i should have been safe  for the cat would have had to return to the ground in order to reach the beech tree  but when i gained the outer end of the birch branch i found to my horror that the gap was full three yards—a terrible jump to risk at any time  but almost certainly fatal if i missed my footing  for before i could recover myself the hungry brute would most infallibly have leaped down upon me   now i was in a tight place indeed  for already the lithe  grey form of my cruel foe was stealing out along the branch to which i clung  her heavier body causing it to sway and vibrate beneath me  it seemed as though i must take the jump  and chance it  suddenly i noticed that the cat had stopped  she was lying close along the branch  her hungry eyes glaring at me  her pink tongue slowly licking her lips  it was clear that she was afraid that if she came further the bough would not bear her weight   this gave me a moment s breathing space  time to glance round and see if any other avenue of escape was open  at once i noticed another birch bough to my left  and a little higher  but still within fairly easy distance  and on the impulse i sprang  landing full upon it  at this the cat  with another blood curdling snarl  turned quickly back towards the trunk  but before she could reach it i was off into the very topmost twigs of the birch  here i felt sure that i was safe  at any rate for the time  for i did not believe the cat would venture so high  to my horror she set herself to follow  and  taking such risks as i never dreamed she would dare  she came slowly but stealthily on my track  all i could do was to crawl out to the thinnest tip that would bear me  cling there  and wait   with horrible pertinacity she followed to the very top of the trunk  and  stationing herself in the last fork that would bear her  crouched there  apparently determined to wait and starve me out   i was at my wits  end  for there seemed no possible avenue of escape  i might remain where i was  you will say  and trust to tiring her out  true  but supposing she refused to be tired out  remember  it was freezing hard  she could endure the cold  i could not  sooner or later my muscles would grow numb  and i should fall either on to the ground or right into her jaws  another thing  i may as well confess it   i was frightened—so badly frightened that this in itself was actually paralysing my powers  after a few minutes i began to feel as though some unexplainable impulse was forcing me to turn and gaze into those fierce green eyes  i had sense enough to be aware that  once i did this  it was all up  i should become fascinated  and drop right into the cruel jaws that waited so hungrily below   against this suicidal impulse i fought with all my might  but in spite of my best efforts it grew upon me until i began to feel that i could endure the torture no longer  it seemed as though it would be a relief to put an end to it  even if it meant ending my life at the same time  the cat seemed to know this  too  and lay below me  stretched at full length  still as the leafless branch on which she crouched   i was actually turning  in another second i should have yielded as weakly as a miserable house mouse  when suddenly a sharp bark resounded from the beech tree near by  the cat stirred  and for the moment i was saved   i looked in the direction of the sound  there was rusty only a few yards away in the beech  cob was close behind him  rusty cried out to me sharply   ‘do you see that bough tip straight below you    ‘yes   i answered dully   ‘can you drop to it    ‘i ll try    ‘don t be a fool  you ve done much bigger things than that  here s our plan  we ll start barking at the cat and take her attention off you while you drop  it s a possible jump from the bough below across to this tree  and you ll have plenty of time  for the cat will have to climb down the trunk  do you understand    ‘yes   i replied faintly   i had been in such a queer dazed condition that i had never even noticed the possible avenue of escape which rusty pointed out  looking down  it seemed a perfectly terrific drop  indeed  it was something like twenty feet  and if i missed it there was another thirty to the frozen snow beneath   ‘are you ready   came rusty s voice  sharp and threatening   ‘yes   i said again   a chorus of perfectly frantic barks and squeaks broke out at once  i heard my enemy move uneasily  and  summoning all my courage  i let myself go and dropped   i struck the branch beneath  fair and square  alas  its twigs were thin  elastic  and slippery with frozen snow  a wild grasp with all four paws failed to stop me  down i went to the ground below   oddly enough  this was where my luck turned  if i had fallen on to the hard frozen surface i should almost certainly have been too stunned to move at once  as it was  i alighted on a spot where only a thin coating of powdery snow covered a deep soft cushion of dead leaves  before the cat was half way down the birch trunk i was in the beech tree   rusty and cob were awaiting me   ‘good squirrel  scud   cried my brother  in tones of such warm praise as absolutely astonished me  for i was intensely ashamed of myself for my cowardice  and for having had such a tumble   however  there was no time to waste  with rusty leading  we were away through the beech into the next tree  and so across the coppice at full speed  the cat  lashing her tail with rage  followed for a while across the snow beneath  and once or twice started climbing again after us  but we were most careful to keep in the thickest part of the wood  and whenever she climbed we merely jumped to the next tree  soon she tired of this—for her—unprofitable pursuit  and stole softly away   not until we had watched her out of the coppice and away along the hedges in the direction of merton spinney did we venture to return to our respective homes  where we shut ourselves up snugly and went to sleep again      chapter viii  i find a wife   after the coming of the grey terror you may imagine how careful we were  we took no more risks of any kind  and when we went out for food invariably took the precaution first to post a sentinel in the nearest tall tree to give good notice of danger  the cat came no more  but all the same  this precaution in all probability saved the lives of rusty and myself  the snow had lasted a long time  but as the weather was sunny and bright we were out most days  one morning  as my brother and i were hunting out some nuts in the centre of a thick part of the hedge  we heard cob s cry of warning from an oak near by  neither of us had any idea from which direction the danger was approaching  but we both were at the top of the hedge in the twinkling of an eye  only just in time  for almost as we left the ground a gaunt red beast bounded on to the very spot which we had left  he was so close that i distinctly heard his sharp teeth click together like the snapping of a steel trap  he looked up with a hungry gleam in his eyes  but quickly recognizing that he had missed his meal  master reynard wasted no time in vain regrets  and trotting sharply off down along the hedge  soon disappeared in the distance  a fox is not particular in snowy weather  all is nuts that comes to his hungry maw   yet we were fated to hear once more of our deadliest foe  the snow had gone  cold rain and heavy gales succeeded it  and then one day dawned so mild and soft and sunshiny that even mother and hazel woke   ‘come  children   said mother  ‘we will go and get some breakfast  open the door  scud    i was in the very act of doing so  when the heavy report of a gun at some distance made us all jump back  a minute later there was a rattle of heavy claws up the trunk of our beech tree  the sound was unmistakable   ‘the cat   i muttered  and we all sank back shivering with fright   right past our closed door came the sound  and up into the boughs above  we could only crouch as still as four mice  if the grey terror found the nest—and her keen nose would tell her that quickly enough—we were absolutely at her mercy   ‘shall we make a bolt for it   muttered rusty in my ear   ‘what s the good  she s above us  she d be certain to get one of us before we could clear   i answered   all was quiet again  but our suspense was almost unendurable  ha  what was that  i could distinctly hear heavy footsteps on the ground below  they seemed to be circling round the base of the tree  then they stopped  and absolute silence reigned   crash  a tremendously heavy report  followed by an unearthly scream  bump  bump  something was falling from bough to bough above  then a heavy thud   ‘ha  ye poaching rascal   came a voice from beneath   curiosity could be restrained no longer  and  lifting the moss a little  i poked my nose through  i could have barked for sheer joy  for there was the tall  ginger whiskered keeper in the very act of picking up a blood stained grey form which lay limp and lifeless on the dead leaves at the foot of the tree  the grey terror was no more   nothing worth chronicling happened during the rest of that winter  early march  i remember  was cold out of the common  so we did not emerge from our winter home until later than usual  at last the frost departed  and one morning i woke up  and  instead of waiting as usual for rusty  sallied out alone  it was exquisitely bright and sunny  with a soft feeling in the air  a gentle westerly breeze stirred the twigs  all red at the tips with new buds  and drove across the blue sky soft rolls of light  smoky cloud  tiny spikes of green were pushing out through the withered tufts of last year s grass  and the birds were singing as i had never heard them sing before   as i ran along the lowest branch of the beech  whom should i meet quite suddenly but cob s sister  little sable  she looked at me in her pretty shy way  murmuring a gentle ‘good morning   and it suddenly occurred to me how extremely pretty she was  i wondered vaguely why i had never before noticed the dainty grace of her shape  the softness of her coat  and the jewel like brilliancy of her eyes  we sat still  gazing at one another for quite a minute  and then suddenly  with a roguish flick of her brush  she bounded past me and away to another branch  where she stopped short and looked back over her shoulder with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes  after her i dashed in full pursuit  but she was gone again before i could reach her   in those days i rather fancied myself at running and jumping  but i don t mind saying that i never had a harder chase to catch any squirrel in my life  she was so extraordinarily quick at dodging and turning that we were both quite out of breath when at last i came up with her   that was the beginning of my courting of my dear wife  but i can tell you that i had no easy task before me  she was the most coquettish little thing  and just when i was beginning to whisper tender speeches in her pretty pointed ears  off she would go with a flick and a spring  and lead me such a dance that i would angrily declare to myself that she did not care a bit for me  you see  i was very young in those days  and not learned in the ways of the fair sex  at other times she would hide herself in some cleft or knot hole  and leave me to search for her by the hour  then  when at last i found her  she would say with an air of the greatest surprise   ‘were you looking for me  scud  oh  i didn t know  what a pity    there was worse to follow  one fine morning  some days later  sable actually consented to come and play down on the grass  we were enjoying a fine game when  all of a sudden  a strange squirrel  one i had hardly seen before—he came from a family who lived quite at the other end of the coppice—appeared on the scene  and  running up to my lady as coolly as you please—  ‘good morning  sable   he said  without so much as looking at me  ‘won t you come up to the fir trees  i know where there are some specially tender shoots    this was a little too much for me   ‘who in hazel nuts are you   i inquired  coming up with my brush straight over my head and all my teeth showing  the beggar pretended not to see me  and began talking to sable again  well  if he didn t see me he felt me  and pretty quickly  too  i went for him on the spot  rolled him over  and got my front teeth well home in his ear  for a minute it was hammer and tongs  we whirled round and round  the fur flying in every direction  he was strong  and snapped viciously  but i never let go  and though he marked me once  the end of it was that he was only too glad to break away and run  i chased him for some distance  and then came back  only to find that sable had calmly gone home  i was so cross with her that i left her alone for the rest of that day  sulking by myself up in the fir trees  what made it worse was that rusty came and laughed at me mercilessly   ‘you don t catch  me  playing the fool like that   he jeered  ‘a bachelor life s good enough for me  thank you    next day sable was as sweet as sugar  and we agreed to be married and set up house together   the next great question was the location of our future home  during the past winter i had seen so plainly how great were the advantages of a hole in a trunk that i quite determined to find similar quarters  as i have said before  i knew the coppice from end to end  and it struck me that there was a beech tree not far from the gate which might suit us  so off we went to have a look at it   on the way we noticed two squirrels fighting savagely on the ground  with a third sitting demurely by  and watching the combat  i had seen half a dozen such fights in the past few days  and did not pay much attention  but sable suddenly stopped and sat up straight   ‘don t you see who it is  scud   she exclaimed  intensely amused   i looked again  and to my utter astonishment  who should the topmost of the two be but my brother rusty   ‘my whiskers  but i m sorry for the other   i laughed   rusty was a terrific fighter  and  indeed  we had not long to wait before his rival broke and ran for dear life  rusty after him   everything went well that happy day  we found a hole high up in the beech tree bole which  with a little hollowing out  made a simply perfect residence  it was close under a large branch  which gave splendid protection from the weather  we wasted no time in setting to work  and by evening had scraped out enough of its rotten sides to make a chamber about nine inches each way  next day we lined it with dry leaves and grey moss  which we stripped from the lower part of the trunk   but our labours were by no means at an end  squirrels are rarely content with one residence  and my experience  short as it had been  had made me plainly understand the advantage of having several  crossing over into a larch on the opposite side of the path  we built a drey on a large flat bough at a good height above the ground  this was all of selected sticks  and was well roofed in  it had a hollow floor and a conical roof  the sticks composing the roof being carefully interlaced in order to keep out the rain  it had an entrance on the east side and a bolt hole on the west  and to close the doors at night  or in cold weather  we provided plenty of moss and soft grass fibre to make stoppers  the only incident of note during these pleasant days was my getting a horrid fright through accidentally digging up a slow worm which had not yet left its winter quarters in the hedge bank where i was pulling up grass roots  ever since my adventure with the viper i have had a perfect horror of snakes  not  of course  that a slow worm is a snake  or in any way dangerous  but still  it looks detestably like one   it seemed odd at first  only two of us in our new home  instead of the four who had snuggled together during the long winter in the old beech tree  but we were far too busy to be dull  and we often saw mother and the rest of our relations  mother was very pleased with our match  and equally so with the two others in our family  for not only had rusty found a wife  but cob and my sister hazel had set up housekeeping together   it used to amuse me  the air of proprietorship which sable exhibited in our tree  i really believe that she considered the whole of it belonged to her  root  trunk  and branch  any stranger squirrel who ventured to intrude had a bad time indeed  he or she was promptly chased off the premises without any ceremony whatever   it was one day in april that our four babies were born  ugly little beasts  i called them  quite hairless  blind and helpless  but when i ventured to remark as much to my wife there was a regular upset  you might hardly believe it  but she turned me out neck and crop  and for the next few days i never ventured home for more than a few minutes at a time  it was difficult even to persuade sable to leave the little beggars long enough to take her meals  early spring is none too easy a time for squirrels to find food in any case  and we were forced to subsist principally on the young shoots and bark of pine and fir trees  it is this habit which gets us such a bad name with keepers and foresters  but we do not do half so much damage as we are credited with   one day  when i was out alone foraging  i met rusty looking very fat and happy   ‘hulloa  scud   he said  ‘you re getting thin  cares of matrimony  eh    ‘they don t appear to worry you very much  anyhow   i retorted  ‘how do you keep so fat    ‘oh  i find plenty of food   he answered lightly  but there was a sort of guilty air about him which puzzled me at the time   a day or two later  when i caught him devouring a nestful of the little blue eggs of the hedge sparrow  i understood   now  eating eggs is a thing which is considered by well bred squirrels to be thoroughly bad form  but  after all  it was no business of mine  rusty was old enough to take his own course  so i said nothing about it  i have often blamed myself since  for one bad habit leads to another  and no doubt my brother s indulgence in eggs that spring was the first step which led to the sad end which afterwards befell him   to return to my own affairs—our kittens grew with astonishing rapidity  and once they opened their eyes began to prove decidedly more interesting  they were three bucks and a doe  in a month they were half as big as myself  and their hair had grown to quite a respectable length  being april kittens  their coats were entirely different from the one which i had worn during my first summer  mine had been reddish brown  and i had had no tufts on my ears  but our young ones had greyish brown coats like the winter one which i was just beginning to discard  and they wore smart little tufts on each ear as well as hair on their palms  one of them  however  was much darker than the other three   sable was the best of mothers  and took the greatest care of her young family  keeping them beautifully neat and clean  before long they grew big enough to be taken out of the nest  and then began a very busy time for their mother and myself  jumping and climbing lessons were the order of the day  remembering how well my mother had instructed me  i took the greatest pains to show them how to spring from one branch to another  how to swing by one hand or foot  to fall without hurting themselves  and how to hide instantly when any danger approached  sometimes we took them down on to the turf below  which was always kept close cropped by the rabbits  and the children enjoyed nothing better than rolling about there  tumbling head over heels  and indulging in all kinds of wild antics   it amused me to see how inquisitive they all were  curiosity is  of course  the besetting sin of the whole of our tribe  and many a one of us has it brought to grief  anything the least bit out of the way had to be examined at once  and no amount of reproof ever seemed to restrain them  curiosity very nearly cost walnut—for so i called the little dark chap  who was my special favourite—his life   one morning i had been over to the other end of the coppice  to a horse chestnut tree which i knew of  young horse chestnut buds  i may remark  make as good a breakfast as almost anything i know of  when i came back i found sable running about on the ground in a most distracted fashion  so soon as she caught sight of me she came flying to tell me that walnut was missing  she was so excited that i had some difficulty at first in making out the facts of the case  it appeared that she had had the whole family out for a game on the grassy sward which bordered the wood path when  all of a sudden  she became conscious that only three of them were in sight  walnut had completely disappeared  the others explained that they had been playing hide and seek  and that walnut had been hiding  they had looked everywhere for him  but could neither find nor hear him   sending them all three back home out of mischief  their mother had set to work to make a vigorous search  but after half an hour s hard hunting  had found no sign of her missing son  i joined her  and we began to quarter out the ground systematically  she taking one side of the path  i the other  but not so much as a hair of walnut s brush could we see  and when the shadows had nearly reached their shortest  i began to feel almost certain that some prowling weasel had caught our poor son  at last it occurred to me that the adventurous young rascal might have gone through the hedge into the open field  and i myself crossed the hedge and ditch  i think i have mentioned before that near the coppice gate on the meadow side was a strip of sandy ground with patches of hawthorn  blackberry bushes  and gorse  which was riddled with rabbit holes  as i wandered sadly across this  occasionally stopping to give a slight bark or a stamp  i suddenly heard a distinct reply  in great delight i hurried forward to a thick clump of gorse from which the sound seemed to come  but when i reached the spot there was no sign of life  i stamped again  and this time there was no doubt whatever about the answer  but it came from underground  then i knew what had happened  walnut had evidently tumbled into a rabbit earth and was unable to get out  very soon i found the hole  and there  sure enough  in the darkness some feet below me i saw my son s eyes   the burrow was a wide and very steep one  and its sides were of extremely soft and loose sand  it was quite plain that walnut  having once fallen in  could get no footing to jump or scramble out  indeed  so he told me in tones that shook with fatigue and fright   i called up sable at once  and she  clever creature that she is  suggested that the best thing to do was to throw down pieces of grass and stick in order to give walnut a footing from which he might jump  it was a long operation  but we finished it at last  and our foolish son once more emerged to the light of day   ‘how  in the name of pine cones  did you ever come to get into such a place   was my first angry question   ‘i saw something white sticking out of it  father   he replied very coolly  ‘and i wanted to find out what it was    i burst out laughing   ‘haven t you ever seen a rabbit s scut before    walnut looked rather foolish   ‘i suppose i have   he answered  ‘but it didn t strike me at the time    things went very quietly and peacefully during the early part of that summer  there were no human intruders whatever  as i found out afterwards  the new people at the hall had stopped all the old footpaths  including the field path which led to the coppice gate  they had great ideas on the subject of high farming and high preserving  but for the present we luckily lived in comparative ignorance of these  one or two things certainly seemed strange  almost all the hedges in the neighbourhood had been cut down and pleached during the winter  making the country side look singularly bare  also several grass fields had been ploughed up and planted with roots or wheat   the ginger haired keeper and a boy—his son  i believe—were often in the coppice  messing about among the undergrowth and collecting whole baskets full of pheasants  eggs  mother was horrified at this performance  but  as we found out later  they took them to the hall to be hatched in incubators  i have spoken of the amount of timber cutting which went on around the hall  one day in the early spring a number of men invaded the coppice and cut away the underbrush and tree branches  so as to make several open rides across the wood from end to end  we were annoyed to see so many good hazel bushes destroyed  but as they did not cut down the heavy timber we were not particularly inconvenienced   we owed that ginger whiskered keeper a debt of gratitude for slaying our enemy  the grey cat  but some of his performances no self respecting coppice dweller could approve of  he began to set horrible gins and snares in every direction  so far as killing off the stoats and weasels went  this was all very well  but it was a sad and dreadful thing to see an unlucky brown owl  the foe of nothing except mice and such like vermin  struggling miserably half the night in the foul jaws of a pole trap  with both its legs broken  jays and magpies suffered also  i had seen traps at the hall  and took particular pains to point them out to my youngsters as objects to be avoided with the utmost care  other young families were not so fortunate  one of rusty s promising sons was missed one day  and found by his mother with his head crushed between cruel iron teeth  stone dead  there is nothing in the world so barbarous as the steel spring trap   that spring and all the early summer were extraordinarily dry  the hay crop was very short  but of excellent quality  while the grain was curiously dwarfed  many of the flowers came out before their time  particularly the white convolvulus and the purple scabious  the brook in the field  i remember  ran altogether dry  and failed to fill a large excavation which the new tenant of the hall had had dug with the intention of making a fish pond  i went to look at it one day  and found it a bare expanse of red clay  netted all over with deep cracks  in the largest and dampest of which a few small  unhappy frogs had found precarious refuge   mother told us that she had never seen weather like it before  and shook her head a good deal  prophesying that food would be as scanty during the coming autumn as it had been plentiful the previous year  certainly there seemed good ground for her forebodings  for the oaks had hardly set any acorns  and there was little sign of mast upon the beech trees  it looked as though the birds  also  would be likely to suffer  for the hips and haws dropped before setting from the drought  the hollies and yews had no berries  and the blackberry crop seemed as though it would be a complete failure   towards the end of july we had a spell of intense heat  we all took up our abode in our summer drey  opening both doors in order to let the draught  when there was any  blow through  and never stirred out except in the early morning and late evening  we felt the heat severely  but  after all  were far better off than the ground creatures  the grass in the meadows outside the gate had turned quite brown  and the unlucky rabbits were forced to travel long distances to find grazing   there are few things  by the bye  which a rabbit dislikes more greatly than venturing any considerable distance from his home  the poor young ones paid a heavy toll to the stoats and weasels during that famine time  for the vermin had them at their mercy when the little chaps visited the hedgerows to look for a little greenstuff   the birds ceased singing almost completely  and the only place where much bird life was still to be seen in our neighbourhood was around the pool down at the end of the coppice  this was almost dry  but a few square yards of stagnant  shallow water still remained in the centre  surrounded by a wide space of mud dotted all over with the footprints of dozens of different species of birds  and not a few four legged creatures as well   it must have been about the twelfth day of the heat  which turned out the most sultry i ever experienced in my life  the sun rose crimson in a crimson sky  no breath of air was abroad  and the leaves hung down straight without a flicker of movement  the coppice was uncannily silent  a silence broken only by the hum of insects  which rose drowsily through the foliage  the only moving things were butterflies  flaunting on painted wings  and a few lizards and snakes—reptiles for which no weather seems too hot   all six of us lay out on the branches under the thickest shade we could find  tongues lolling out  too listless to trouble about food or even to talk  as the afternoon drew on  and the shadows lengthened towards the east  i suggested to sable that we should go off in search of supper  i mentioned an oat field just across the road  where i had an idea that the grain would be ripe enough to provide an easily won meal   but sable said no  that it was still too hot for the children  that i had better go alone  if the oats were really ripe  we would all journey there next morning for breakfast  i never argue with my wife  my first week of wedded life taught me that such a proceeding is an entire waste of time and energy  so answering  ‘very well  my dear   i rose  stretching and yawning lazily  and went leisurely away towards my destination  after all  sable was quite right when i reached the open  the sun still stung with hardly abated power  and the heat mist shimmered over the baking ground   the oat field had turned quite golden in the past few days  but it was pitiful to see how short was the straw  how light the heads  and how small the grain  i had it all to myself  and wandered about  picking out the heaviest heads and nibbling in leisurely fashion  suddenly a low distant mutter of thunder boomed through the stagnant air  and it struck me that it might be wise to make for home  but before i could even reach the hedge there sounded a second and louder peal  and to my amazement a quarter of the northern sky was already swallowed by a huge mass of vapour  purplish black in colour  and rimmed with a tumbling edge of boiling mist white as snow  the cloud was advancing with amazing rapidity  and as i sprang into a pollard oak at the corner of the hedge  to get a better view  it swallowed up the sun  and a sudden darkness fell upon the thirsty land  then i saw that the deep bosom of the ponderous storm cloud was laced by constant streaks of blue and silver fire  such a sight is not seen once in a generation of squirrels  and it so deeply interested me that for the moment i entirely forgot my intention of returning home  and sat there watching the gathering tempest with fascinated eyes   a great tongue of blue flame licked downwards  and a moment later the thunder crashed in real earnest  there was a hoarse murmur in the far distance  and i saw the tree tops  fields away across the level country side  bend their tall heads as the first gust struck them  presently a breath of air  cold  damp  and delicious  ruffled my fur  and  as the lightning flared again through the gloom  the first drop of rain  the size of a wren s egg  struck me full in the face   with a sudden start i realized that it was now too late to dream of returning  and that  if i wished to avoid the worst ducking of my life  i must seek shelter of some kind  racing round the club like top of the pollard i discovered a knot hole just large enough to hold me  and into this i forced my way—barely in time  for almost instantaneously the full force of the tempest was upon me  one gust of wind  so fierce that i felt the sturdy old oak quiver to its very roots  then a smashing downpour of hail  not ordinary hail  but lumps of ice as large as walnuts  which almost instantaneously levelled the field of oats flat with the ground  stripped the foliage from the trees  and danced into white drifts which lay inches deep against the hedge bank   in between the hail clouds pennons of blue and white electric fire sprang and vanished  but the clamour of the pounding ice and the roar of the wind almost drowned the bellowing thunder  closer and closer glared the lightning  the hail turned to rain  which fell in solid sheets  the sharp alternations between darkness and intense white light dazzled me so greatly that i could hardly see  i felt stunned  deafened  and horribly frightened   of a sudden the rain ceased absolutely  instantly the whole world was bathed in white fire  and simultaneously the very heavens seemed to crack with a crash that  i think  actually stunned me for the moment  when i came to myself again it was raining almost as fiercely as ever  flash and crash still followed for some minutes with hardly abated rapidity and intensity  but very soon it began to grow lighter  the storm  like most such  was of small area  and travelling so rapidly that it passed almost as quickly as it had come    illustration  down the near side of the trunk was a deep and wide new scar   ‘my poor sable   i thought as i started hurriedly homewards  ‘what a terrible fright she and the kittens will have had   as i crossed the road into the coppice signs of the storm were everywhere visible  the ground was covered with green leaves  among which the fast melting hail drifts gleamed oddly white  every puddle brimmed  every branch dripped  and from the meadow below the voice of the swollen brook rose hoarsely   i made along the hedge  crossed into the coppice trees  and rattled rapidly homewards among the soaking foliage  a slight smoke rising in the distance startled me  but it was without the slightest premonition of coming misfortune that i quickened my pace  uttering a slight bark to signal my approach   there was no reply  and the last part of my way i covered at full speed  reaching the nearest side of the path  i stopped  stared  staggered  and nearly lost my hold  it was from our own beech tree that the smoke was rising  the ground below was strewn with white fragments of splintered wood  down the near side of the trunk was a deep and wide new scar  blackened in the centre   shaking and trembling all over  i crept up  but  no  i cannot tell you what i saw  they had all taken refuge in the nest  and their death must have been mercifully instantaneous      chapter ix  war declared against our race   i think the shock of the disaster which robbed me at one fell swoop of wife  family  and home must have so completely stunned all my faculties that for a time i was unable to realize fully what had happened  i vaguely remember wandering round and about the still faintly steaming ruins of the beech tree  and calling piteously for sable  lucky for me that no enemy came near  even a boy with a catapult could have made an easy prey of me  for all my senses were strangely dulled   what first brought me to myself again was a low but familiar call which came from a small larch near by  looking up  i could hardly believe my eyes when i caught sight of a small dark squirrel crouching on a branch at no great height from the ground shivering piteously   ‘walnut   i exclaimed in absolute amazement   i had felt so certain that the poor charred remains in my broken home comprised the whole of my family  was it possible that one of them had escaped  after all   the poor little chap was so shockingly frightened that it was a long time before he could give me any clear account of how he had escaped  it appears that when my poor sable saw the storm coming she at once set to work to take her family from the summer drey in the larch back to the hollow in the beech trunk  she had been afraid  walnut said  that the wind might blow the drey away  the jump across the path from tree to tree being too much for the youngsters  their mother had led the way down to the ground  ordering them all to follow her closely  walnut  however  who had never seen a thunderstorm  and who  of course  did not realize the danger  thought it would be a fine joke to remain behind  in the hurry of the moment sable  no doubt  never noticed until too late that he was not with the others  and when the storm broke the darkness at once became almost impenetrable   when the hail began  walnut  terrified almost out of his senses  wished most devoutly that he had not been such a fool  for great lumps of ice beat through the roof of the drey  and the tree swayed so frightfully that he expected every moment the whole nest would be torn away and sent flying in fragments to the ground  however  it was too late for useful repentance  so he was forced to stay where he was  then came the final fearful crash  and he remembered nothing more until he found himself clinging desperately to a bough a long way below the drey  when the weather cleared a little he had gone across to the beech tree  but the smoke frightened him so that he had not dared to climb   that night we two spent amid the dripping ruins in the larch  after the great heat the night breeze struck bitter cold  and we lay chilled and shivering  though too miserable to care much one way or the other  as soon as ever it grew light we left that part of the coppice for ever  i took my son to the extreme opposite end of the wood  and there had the good luck to stumble almost immediately upon possible quarters  these were in a vast oak  the boughs of which were beginning to decay from sheer old age  in the end of one branch  broken short off by some long past gale  was a deep hole which had evidently been formerly the habitation of a pair of stock doves  for the remains of their nest were mouldering just inside the entrance  i had no spirit to build new quarters  so with sore hearts we took possession of this shelter  later  when i recovered my energies a little  i collected moss to line it  and made a dry and fairly comfortable residence   of the time that followed i will not speak  but for walnut i should not have cared to live  as it was  i hardly took the trouble to eat  but sat and moped from day to day  until i grew thin and bony  my coat stared  and i looked like an old squirrel   but time cures all sorrows  and happily for us  just as a squirrel s life is shorter than a man s  so much the more rapidly do his griefs pass away  walnut grew from day to day  and became a strong  handsome fellow  well able to take care of himself  i was very proud and fond of him  and gradually his bright companionship did me good  and amid new scenes i began slowly to take a fresh interest in life   our new home was very near to the far end of the wood path  close to the other gate  which opened on to the road  the same road which ran past the hall  across the brook  to the village beyond  as i have  i think  mentioned before  the new people at the hall had closed this path  padlocked the gates  and posted notices forbidding anyone from using the short cut  this course caused intense dissatisfaction among the villagers  and more than once i saw a passing labourer shake his fist in silent anger as he tramped along the dusty road past the locked  iron spiked gate   it was not long before we began to realize the reason of this proceeding  one day the ginger whiskered keeper appeared outside the gate with a cart loaded with coops  unlocking the gate  he and another man carried in the coops one by one  all our curiosity aroused  walnut and i followed cautiously  and watched them lay the coops down in an open glade  not far from our oak tree  open them  and let loose dozens of young pheasants  which scuttled about without attempting to fly  tame as so many barn door fowls  next came a proceeding which interested me far more  taking two bags from the cart  the keeper proceeded to scatter a quantity of indian corn and other food about in the grass  then  picking up the coops  he departed   so soon as ever they were gone  down swooped walnut and myself  and  sending the frightened young pheasants scuttling in every direction  set to work on the corn  it was nearly a year since i had tasted this delicacy  which jack fortescue used to give me as a treat in the old  quiet days at the hall  the food was a godsend to us  for  as i have said  the supply of nuts  mast  and acorns  was of the shortest in our neighbourhood that season  i let my mother know  and she as well as cob and my sister and their young ones were very soon on the spot  the pheasants got precious little of that meal  or of many subsequent ones which the keeper carefully brought day by day  however  they were not much to be pitied  for the supply of ants  eggs was plentiful all over the coppice  and pheasants do better on ants  eggs than on almost any artificial food they can be given   i noticed that rusty never troubled to come down to the pheasant food  though his wife and family of three sturdy sons regularly attended our daily free feed  i had my own suspicions  and these were confirmed when his wife told me that he was often away for whole days together  when she remonstrated with him he only laughed  and this made her seriously uneasy  rusty had grown to be the largest and most powerful squirrel that i have ever seen in my life  no other in the wood could have stood up to him for a minute  he was also astonishingly brave and independent  and would venture across open fields for any distance   one day he said to me   ‘hulloa  scud  why don t you ever come to the hall nowadays  i believe you re scared  don t you want another taste of those cob nuts    ‘you don t mean to say you go there   exclaimed i   ‘of course i do  great polecats  do you think i ve got nothing better to do than mess about here all day picking up a few rotten grains of corn or green acorns    ‘you ran fast enough on the day you and i got shot at   i retorted  rather annoyed at his insinuations   ‘a precious pair of young idiots we were   he returned scornfully  ‘i take jolly good care they don t see me nowadays    ‘how do you manage that    ‘why  in the first place i go at dawn  before any one is about  in the second  i don t cut across the lawn  but round to the right of the house  are you game to come to morrow morning    a longing to see the old place once more came over me  i was also anxious to find out what rusty was about  for i did not believe for a moment that the attraction lay in the cob nuts  i hesitated   ‘very well   said rusty  taking my silence for consent  ‘meet me at sun up by the pool at the other end of the wood    i won t describe how we reached the hall  except to say that  instead of working down the road hedge to the left  as we had done on the previous occasion  we struck boldly out down the right hand side to the large meadow  rusty guided me round to the home farm buildings  which lay some quarter of a mile to the right of the hall  the farm and rick yards were surrounded on two sides by a stone wall  outside which was a strip of laurel shrubbery   ‘now  you wait here   said rusty with a patronizing air which i could not help resenting  ‘i m going over the wall for my breakfast  you needn t watch if you don t like    ‘don t be a fool  rusty   exclaimed i angrily  for i thought it sheer bravado on his part  ‘there s nothing to eat there  except the chicken grain you profess to despise    ‘oh  isn t there   jeered my brother  and before i could say another word he had leaped on to the wall  and with another bold spring was down in the yard   it was still very early  a bright cloudless august morning  and everything dripping with dew  the place appeared to be deserted  although from the kitchen chimney of the farm house a slight blue smoke was rising  climbing into the top of a laurel  i got a good view of the whole yard  and watched rusty nimbly scuttle across towards the further buddings  behind these he was lost to sight   suddenly arose the wild cackling of a frightened hen  and next moment  to my utter horror  there came rusty round the corner of a shed  head up  as bold as brass  with a young chicken swinging by the neck between his sharp teeth  at the same moment i saw—what he failed to notice—a man  who raised his head cautiously over the half door of a cowshed on the far side of the yard  and the level rays of the rising sun glinting on the barrels of a gun  i gave one sharp bark of warning  too late  a puff of smoke sprang from the muzzle  the heavy report sent the sparrows up in a chattering cloud  and of my brother no more remained than a little red rag of broken fur stretched on the cobbles which paved the yard   i suppose the man with the gun could not have heard my attempted warning  if he had  nothing could have saved me  for i was too horror stricken for the moment to move at all  i sat like a stuffed squirrel and watched him walk across to where rusty lay  ‘well  i never would ha  believed it   he said wonderingly  holding the small bunch of mangled fur out at arm s length  ‘if one of them chicks has gone i ve lost a dozen  and to think it was this here little red rascal   he turned and called loudly  ‘jim  bring me a hammer and a nail    a tousle headed boy came out of the back door of the farm house with the required implements  the man took the hammer  and deliberately nailed the dead body of my brother against the tarred wooden wall of one of the barns  ‘you ll do for a warning   he remarked grimly as he turned away  and  sick at heart  i dropped out of sight and made the best of my way back to the coppice   such was the end of the strongest and bravest squirrel whom i ever knew  you must not imagine for one moment that such a crime as he was guilty of is a common one among squirrels  it is  indeed  very rare for one of our family to take to a carnivorous diet  but when he does fall into such a habit he never abandons it  they say that there is a kind of parrot in new zealand  called the kea  which in old days  before sheep were imported into the islands  lived entirely upon seeds and insects  but the bird found it was easier to pick at the raw skins of newly killed sheep  hung out on the fences  than to hunt food for itself  and  once it acquired a taste for blood  there was no more caterpillar hunting for the kea  next thing the shepherds knew  sheep were found dying or dead all over the ranges  the fat above the kidneys torn out by the powerful hooked beak of this goblin bird  now the government has set a price upon the head of the kea  and the outlaw lives a proscribed and hunted life   far be it from the squirrels that  as a race  they should take to the evil habit of flesh eating  but from time immemorial a few in each generation have begun with devouring birds  eggs  from that gone on to eating young hedge sparrows  redstarts  and the like  and finally  like my poor brother  taken to larger game  such as young pheasants  ducks  or chickens  but they seldom have the chance of long continuing such raids  for  unlike foxes  rats  polecats  and other enemies of the poultry yard  they do not hunt by night  but boldly in broad daylight  consequently they almost inevitably meet fate in the shape of a charge of lead    illustration  ‘and to think it was this here little red rascal    whether the man who shot rusty told the story to the ginger whiskered keeper  or whether the latter himself surprised some of us feasting on his pheasant food in the coppice i do not know  but from that very day dated the war against the squirrels on the hall estate   that same afternoon  having discharged the unpleasant duty of telling poor rusty s widow of the sad event of the morning  i was roaming sadly about our oak tree  searching under the bark for the insects which inhabited the rotten wood  when i heard a gun fired twice at the other end of the coppice  at first i hardly moved  for i took it that the keeper was merely killing a weasel or some such vermin  but when two more shots followed quickly  and immediately afterwards the vicious crack  crack of a lighter weapon  i was amazed  for  like all other woodland dwellers  i was perfectly well aware that the shooting season had not yet commenced  when the double barrel spoke again  and this time nearer  i called walnut  who was up in the top branches  and together we took hasty refuge in our hole   we had not been there five minutes before there came a quick scuttering of claws up the rough bark  and simultaneously the tramping of heavy feet through the bracken at a little distance   i was moving to the entrance to find out what was going on when something fairly shot into the hole  knocking me back to its farthest end  when i had picked myself up  there was cob lying panting  almost too much exhausted to speak   ‘they re after us  scud   he gasped at last   ‘who  what    ‘the keeper and a boy  they ve shot three of us already  and i m frightened to death about hazel  i was away from home and couldn t get back  i saw three dead bodies    here a gruff human voice broke in from below   ‘where s the dratted little beggar got to  i seed him jump into this here oak  he can t be far off    ‘he s sure to be in one of the holes in the trunk   replied more sharply pitched tones which i recognized at once as those of the high collared boy whose mark i still bore in the shape of a shot hole in one ear  ‘climb up  tompkins  and see    ‘climb  thank ee  sir  i wasn t engaged to break my neck climbing trees—not at my age  tell you what  sir  i ll go on with the gun  you can wait here quietly  and after a bit he s sure to come out  and then you can shoot him    ‘all right   answered the boy  and we plainly heard tompkins stamping off  cob was crazy to get away and go in search of his wife and family  but the boy below  who had about as much idea of woodcraft as a frog has of flying  made such a noise moving from one foot to the other  breathing hard and shifting his rifle about  that even a hedgehog would have known better than to take the chances of showing himself   his patience was about on a par with his other performances  for in less than five minutes he became tired of waiting  and moved off after the keeper   but we heard no more shots  bad news spreads like magic in a wood  and by this time every squirrel of the forty or fifty who inhabited our coppice was snug under cover  and it would have taken better eyes than those of ginger or his young friend to find us  after another half hour or so we heard the far gate slam to  and knew that danger was over—at least  for the present  then cob went off as hard as his legs would carry him  and later on i was delighted to hear that he had found hazel and his two young ones quite safe and unhurt   to say that we were furious at this wanton massacre is to put our feelings very mildly  from time out of mind the lives of the squirrels on the hall estate had been sacred  and except when trespassing louts—such as those who had caused the death of my father—had attacked us we had lived safe and happy from one generation to another   as a race  we squirrels are very conservative and home loving  so long as we are not molested  the same families and their children remain in the same wood year after year  never emigrating unless driven to do so by over population or lack of food  if  on the other hand  the squirrels in any particular locality are regularly persecuted by man  always their worst enemy  the survivors will very soon clear out completely  there are to day whole tracts of beautiful beech woods in buckinghamshire  where  though food is perhaps as plentiful as anywhere else in england  yet hardly a squirrel is to be seen  our race has been so harried that they have left altogether  modern high preserving is what we unlucky squirrels cannot stand  where the owner s one idea is to get as large a head of pheasants as the coverts can possibly carry  every other woodland creature goes to the wall  and the keepers shoot us down as mercilessly as they kill kestrels  owls  jays  hedgehogs  and a dozen other harmless birds and beasts   very soon it became clear that the new tenant of the hall had declared war against us  the pheasants  of which an immense number had been turned down  were his only care  he used to come and strut about while tompkins was feeding them  as walnut said  he only needed a long tail and a few feathers to resemble exactly a stupid old  stuck up cock pheasant himself   again and again during that august tompkins with his twelve bore  and the band box boy with a small repeating rifle  invaded the wood and fired indiscriminately at every squirrel they could set eyes on  but  as you may imagine  we very soon learnt caution  and when news of their approach was signalled from tree to tree  every squirrel in the coppice took instant cover  still  our enemies occasionally succeeded in cutting off one of our number in some tree where total concealment was impossible  and then the cruel little brute of a boy would make him a target for his tiny bullets  often inflicting half a dozen wounds before a vital spot was struck  then at last the tightly clutching claws would slowly relax  and the poor  bleeding little body come thudding down from bough to bough  to be pounced on by the young murderer with a yell of fiendish glee   in those days i kept walnut very close at home  except at dawn or just before dusk we never ventured far from cover  with the result that neither was ever shot at  it was uncommonly lucky for us that this was the time of most plentiful food  for otherwise  being afraid to roam far in search of provender  we must often have gone hungry  but though  as i have already mentioned  the early drought had caused a famine in nuts  acorns  and mast  yet there was plenty else to eat  it was as wet now as it had been dry in the earlier part of the year  and the steamy heat had produced amazing crops of mushrooms and other fungi  the hedgerows  too  which before the rain had looked thin and brown  were now full of rank  new growth  while as for insects of all kinds  they fairly swarmed  on the pheasant food  too  we levied regular toll  in any case  the fool of a keeper threw down twice as much as the birds cared to eat   in those days our enemy was busy with other weapons beside the gun  men were constantly at work lopping the underbrush to keep the rides open  while much spading went on to clear the water logged ditches   september was three parts gone  and the pheasants were nearly full grown  but as yet so tame that they had almost to be kicked before they would use their wings  they were still fed in the small glade close below the oak  when walnut and i  peeping out cautiously from the end of the hollow branch  would watch our enemy with the ginger whiskers strewing the wheat  and then  as soon as he was safely out of the gate  make a wild rush down and eat our fill  pheasants are quite the most utter fools of any birds that i know  with their great weight and strong beaks we could have done nothing to resist had they chosen to attack us when we raided their larder  but this never seemed to occur to them  you have only to look very fierce and rush at him for the largest cock pheasant to run for dear life   more often than before  the new master of the hall began to accompany his keeper and watch the feeding process  great hazel sticks  the man was as fussy as a hen with ducklings   however  there s many a slip  twixt the nut and the teeth  and our pompous friend was not destined to have things all his own way after all      chapter x  poachers and a battue   one still night about ten days before the end of september  walnut and i were roused by a light which  flashing across the opening to our retreat  was reflected into our eyes  it passed immediately  but not before we were both broad awake   several men were trampling about close underneath the oak   ‘lie still  walnut   i ordered uneasily  for this was something new to me  i had never before heard men moving in the wood so late at night  and i was at first inclined to think that there might be some new plot of tompkins or his satellites a foot  very cautiously i peered out  there was a young moon somewhere behind the soft veil of cloud  which covered the sky so that it was not too dark to see the figures of three men moving cautiously across the glade in which the pheasants fed  one carried a dark lantern  the tiny beam of light from which was what had roused us the moment before   ‘they ll be in them young beeches   said one in a hoarse whisper  ‘there ain t any in the oak    i saw them all three move cautiously across into a clump of young beeches which stood just across the glade  there they stopped  and the lantern was flashed upwards into the low branches  its light gleaming golden upon the yellowing leaves  a slight rustle followed  and a voice muttered   ‘i sees  em  shut the lantern an  help me fix the smudge    the three now stooped together on the ground and appeared to be gathering dry leaves and heaping them together in a little pile  presently i heard the faint scratching of a match  and a small blue flame illuminated three eager faces  two of them were men whom i had never seen before  the third i recognized as a labourer whom i had more than once watched shake his fist fiercely as he passed the locked gate of the coppice   the man who held the match touched it to the leaves  but before they could burst into bright flame the two others penned the little fire by holding a couple of sacks round it   one of the men threw a handful of powder over the fire which at once choked it down  making it burn with a sickly blue flame  then they all three stood perfectly still  hiding the fire with their sacks  but keeping their heads turned as far as possible away from the smoke which went wreathing up in thick columns into the foliage above them   before many moments had passed there came a slight whirr  the sound of wings beating on leaves  and with a flop  down fell a great pheasant almost on the heads of the watchers  quick as a cat  one of the men reached out one arm  seized the bird  and wrung its neck  he had hardly done so when there was another rustle and thud  and a second of our oppressor s pets shared the fate of the first   it was evident that from the stuff they put in the flame there arose poisonous fumes that stupefied the roosting birds   very soon even we could smell the noisome stuff  and walnut wrinkled up his nose in disgust  even a human being  let alone a squirrel  whose sense of smell is fifty times more acute  could easily have perceived it    illustration  a small blue flame illuminated three eager faces    presently the poachers lifted up the whole fire  which we now saw had been built upon a small square of sheet iron  and removed it bodily to a fresh spot  under another tree  here no fewer than four pheasants were secured one after another  and then the fire was moved again  so they went on for two hours or more  working round and round the glade  as nearly all the pheasants roosted in this part of the coppice there was no need to go further afield  at last  when their sack was fairly bulging with dead game  they took their departure   twice during the next three nights did the gang of poachers return  and each time went home with a score or more of long tails  tompkins at last began to miss his birds at feeding time  and to suspect that something was wrong  walnut and i sat secure in our retreat overhead  and jeered at the man s utter stupidity  why  even if he had no nose for the brimstone  of which the whole place fairly reeked  there were great footprints all over the place telling their story in large type to anyone who had eyes  yet the keeper absolutely walked over them without looking at them  the very idea of poachers never seemed to occur to him  i verily believe he thought that we had something to do with the disappearance of his precious pheasants  for as he left the coppice he fired at and killed a poor young cousin of ours   the leaves had begun to fall once more  when one day the pompous little fat man accompanied tompkins through the coppice  they stopped in the glade below us  and it was evident the new tenant was uneasy  he began peering and pointing  and questioning the keeper as if he were only half satisfied   ‘oh  they re all right  sir   replied the keeper hastily  in answer to his questions  ‘you see  sir  they ve got so big now they don t need the grain  they re round in the bracken finding their own feed    the master swallowed his story like a thrush swallowing a worm  indeed  he was evidently rather pleased  for he thought the birds would be wild and strong on the wing for next day   that same night i was wakened by gunshots  never before had i heard a gun fired at night  and the sound was most alarming  i thought at first that the firing was at a distance  but just as i looked out the darkness was lit by a flash quite close at hand  the report was  however  strangely slight  as a matter of fact  the guns were loaded with reduced charges   immediately at the report down flopped a pheasant to the ground  the poacher gang were at work  and as time was short were shooting the pheasants as they roosted  pop  pop  pop  the pheasants were falling at the rate of one a minute  there would be very few left for our stout friend at the hall and his swell city friends next day  two sacks were full   ‘just a dozen more   we heard one of them say   ‘right oh   answered another  he spoke out loud  for by this time the gang had been so long undisturbed that they had become quite reckless  and neglected the precautions which they had at first observed   the words were hardly out of his mouth before there was a sudden rush of feet  and there came the keeper  his son  another man  and the fourth was no other than the new tenant himself   ginger recklessly rushed forward shouting  next instant a gun cracked—i never saw who fired the shot—and ginger  with a hideous yell  fell forward on his face  and lay twitching in a horrid fashion on the ground   i saw ginger s son charge forward  swinging his stick  with the other man close behind him  i saw the poachers run for their lives  leaving the spoil behind them  but what was the new squire about  he never budged  but stood there like a stuck pig  and even in the dim light it was easy to see his legs quaking and the shivers that shook his podgy frame   not until poachers and pursuers had vanished through the trees  and the crashing sound of their running feet had almost died in the distance  did the cowardly little man move slowly up to where his keeper lay   ‘are—you—much—hurt  tompkins   he stammered  in shaking accents   tompkins only groaned  and the stout man  kneeling beside him  fairly wrung his hands in hopeless incompetency  at last he seemed to remember something  and pulling out a flask from his pocket  put it to tompkins s lips just as the keeper s son and the other man returned empty handed   the new squire turned on them  storming at them for having allowed the poachers to escape  without seeming to heed the fact that his keeper still lay unconscious at his feet  he stamped and swore and almost shrieked in his impotent anger  presently his son and the other man hoisted up tompkins  who seemed to have got the charge in his legs  and between them carried him off  the little stout man stalking growling along in the rear  then  at last  walnut and i were left to get some sleep   however  there was no peace for us  by ten o clock next day the coppice was full of beaters  making noise enough to rouse a dormouse  and scaring the remaining pheasants nearly out of their feathers  instead of running or hiding  the silly birds immediately rose and flew up over the trees  and then began such a salvo of firing as none of us had ever heard in our lives before  the whole coppice was full of the sharp  sour smell of smokeless powder  and as for us and the other coppice dwellers  we cowered in the very deepest corners of our various refuges  and waited with shaking bodies and aching heads for the din to cease  at last it did stop  but only to break out afresh at the next spinney  and so on all day round the whole country side   in the afternoon  after it was all over  and just as walnut and i were starting out to find our evening meal  there came a fresh invasion  it was headed by the stout new tenant  gorgeously arrayed in a check shooting suit  which in itself was enough to scare any self respecting squirrel out of his wits  and with him walked five others like unto himself  he was evidently giving them all an account  a glorified account  of what had happened  by the way he pointed and ran a few steps  and let fly with his fist  it seemed as if he personally must have killed the whole gang of poachers  and they all listened attentively  though one or two laughed behind his back   i learnt afterwards from cob that he had seen a man going about with the sacks full of dead pheasants the poachers had dropped  he had scattered them here and there throughout the wood  this had puzzled him much  and he had watched to see if they were left there  but  no  when the shoot was over the pheasants were picked up again with those that had really been shot by the guests  and in this way they made up quite a big bag   all this poaching business does not seem to have much to do with my life  indirectly  however  it had  for the new tenant of the hall was so angry about the poaching that on the very day after the battue he set a whole gang to work to run barbed wire—of all awful things —round the whole of the coppice  other men were put to lop the hedges close  and two new keepers engaged  the latter were worse than tompkins  i suppose it was by way of justifying their existence that they walked about all day with their guns  firing at almost everything they could see that was not game  it became almost impossible to show our noses outside our homes during daylight  and many an evening walnut and i went hungry to bed  life became one prolonged dodging  for even when the new keepers were not about the workmen would take pot shots with stones at any of us they could view  incidentally  too  they knocked over many a fat rabbit and dozens of the remaining pheasants  but of these proceedings their employer  intent on saving his coverts from the village poachers  remained in blissful ignorance   at last there came a crisis  walnut and i had taken advantage of the quiet of the midday hour—the men being at their dinner—to steal out and get some beech mast  when suddenly a missile of some sort hissed just above my head  cutting away a twig close above  i paused an instant in utter amazement  for i had heard no report  when—ping  another bullet whacked on the bark close below my feet  and there was a brute of a boy in corduroys  his head peering from behind a trunk  and in the very act of stretching the elastic of a heavy catapult  one quick bark to walnut  and we were both away as hard as we could lay legs to the branches  a third buckshot whizzed close behind my brush as i fled  the boy  seeing us run  at once followed and began positively showering shot after us  it was impossible to reach home under the bombardment  and if we had not been lucky enough to find a knot hole in a beech just large enough to shelter the two of us  one or other—both  perhaps—would have been maimed or killed   this was the last straw  for some days a vague resolution had been forming slowly in my brain  that night  as we crouched  almost too hungry to sleep  in our oak tree home  i told walnut we could stay there no longer  but must leave the coppice where we had so long sheltered   he seemed rather to like the idea than otherwise  being young and ready for adventure   very early next morning i slipped across to the old beech and told my mother  i was anxious that she and the others should accompany us  but this she would not do   ‘no  scud  i am too old to leave my home  i shall stay here and take my chances  but you  i think  are wise to go  waste no time in getting off  for you must be well away before the men come to their work    a few minutes later walnut and i had crossed the road and were hastening away across an open field bound due north  we went that way because we could go no other—a squirrel migrating invariably travels north  i do not know the reason  but some instinct implanted in us ages and ages ago  perhaps even before men began to walk erect  tells us to do so  and we obey it  and shall obey it  thousands of years hence  in just the same way the norwegian lemmings march in their myriads towards the sea  and are drowned in the salt waves in a vain  instinctive effort to reach some place that has long disappeared beneath the waves   i cannot tell you all our wanderings or the perils that we encountered by the way  twice walnut was very nearly caught by a weasel  once a wide winged hen sparrow hawk came whistling down out of the blue as we were crossing an open field  and we escaped only by a happy accident into an old drain tile which happened to lie near by  in this narrow refuge we both squeezed our trembling bodies until the bird of prey had departed in disgust   we travelled very slowly  stopping sometimes for a whole day in any coppice in which we happened to find ourselves  several times we almost made up our minds to remain for good in one or other of these woods  but always the same difficulty stood in our way  the scarcity of food was universal  all the country side had suffered alike from the great drought of the early summer  and mast  acorns  and nuts alike were conspicuous by their absence  as far as the present went  we did well enough  in autumn a squirrel can always find food of some kind or another   the love of wandering was like a fever  in the course of a week or so we two had become regular vagabonds  there was an absolute fascination in new scenes each day and new quarters each night  and  feeling that we had cut ourselves off for ever from all our ties  there seemed no special object in stopping anywhere in particular   and yet at times i was anxious  i knew well enough that winter was coming  and that we must settle down and find a home and collect stores before the cold weather   there came a morning when the sky was full of high wind cloud  but the air so clear that distant objects seemed but a few fields away  and  leaving a small fir plantation on the flank of a hill where we had spent the night  we looked down upon a deep valley  along the bottom of which was a long line of timber  wide in some places  narrow in others  between the thinning autumn foliage one caught here and there the sparkle of running water  a mile or more down the valley  and on the far side of the river  a large old fashioned house  that vaguely reminded me of the hall  lay against the steep side of the opposite slope  with gardens terraced to the water edge   the wood behind it was all that we could have hoped  and more  ancient trees of enormous girth and size grew so thick and close that the sun seldom if ever reached the thickets of undergrowth beneath their spreading tops  hardly a sign was to be seen of the interfering hand of man  and though the place was full of wild life—rabbits  wood pigeons  and the like—pheasants were conspicuous by their absence  a peculiarity of the wood  no doubt on account of its damp  sheltered position  was the immense amount of ivy which covered the massive trunks with clinging tendrils and dark green leaves  there was food too  for the oaks whose roots no doubt penetrated far below the level of the stream  had a fair crop of acorns  and  better still  there were hazel bushes close along the water s edge which were still fairly full of ripe nuts  the place was a perfect paradise from a squirrel s point of view  and my half joking suggestion of spending the winter in it speedily became a fixed idea   the first thing to do was to find a residence  this was an easy task  for there were dozens to choose from  walnut was very keen upon an old magpie s nest which he found in a huge thorn tree  and which was still in excellent repair even to the roof  but i had had enough of built nests  and preferred a knot hole in a beech  once a squirrel takes to living in holes in trees  he usually sticks to the same description of residence to the end of his days   one fact which struck me as odd during our first day s exploration of the river side wood was the almost entire absence of our own tribe  we only saw two squirrels besides ourselves  and they were young and anything but friendly  in fact  they both bolted before we could have a word with them   it was the drumming of heavy rain among the dying foliage above that woke us at daylight next morning  the sky was one uniform grey  and everything was soaking and dripping  we had reason indeed to be thankful that we had found a warm dry home  for this weather looked like lasting   last it did  all day long  and as there was nothing else to do we curled up and slept  evening came  and still it rained—harder if anything than before  it was too wet to go out and forage  and so we went hungry to bed  it is a fortunate dispensation that we squirrel folk can go for long periods without food if we can find a dry place to sleep in  for i have seldom known a squirrel who would not sooner be hungry than wet   next morning it was still raining  though not so hard  large pools lay in every depression  and the hoarse roar of the swollen river echoed through the soaking woods  rain had now been falling for thirty six hours straight on end  and we had been all that time without a meal   walnut told me he was simply starving  and must go out and find a few acorns   i let him go  but  being sleepy  i did not accompany him   i was not at all uneasy about him  for the wood seemed safe enough  and walnut  now more than six months old  was well able to take care of himself  as for me  i drowsed until about midday  and then looking out again found that the downpour had at last ceased and the sun was shining once more  i missed walnut  for i was so much accustomed to his nestling beside me  and  stretching lazily  i sallied forth to look for him  stepping daintily along the soaking boughs in order to avoid bringing down upon myself the great drops of moisture which hung on every yellowing leaf  i made straight for the hazel bushes  which we had found on the first day near to the water s edge  but when i came in sight of the river i could hardly believe my eyes  so tremendous a change had the great rain wrought  in place of the shallow stream that purled across pebble beds from pool to pool  a broad torrent  red with the clay of the upland fields  was raging down with appalling force and fury  even where the banks had been highest the flood was level with their tops  and in many places it had overflowed them so that the nut bushes stood up like islands among wide backwaters where the current eddied lazily  swinging on its discoloured surface millions of dead leaves and sticks   the sight fairly fascinated me  and for the moment i forgot my hunger  walnut  and everything else in watching the irresistible force of the rushing torrent and noticing the speed at which the logs and sticks which it had tom from its banks were carried downwards    illustration  another moment found me comfortably perched in the branches of the hazel bushes    but hunger soon reasserted its claims  and i began to reconnoitre for the best means of reaching the nut bushes and breakfast  a little further down the stream a low  flat topped oak extended its spreading branches more than half way across the flooded river  and i saw that from the point of one of its long limbs it would be easy to drop into a good sized clump of hazel bush below  no sooner seen than done  and another minute found me comfortably perched in the branches of the hazel bushes cracking nuts and eating them with a naturally fine appetite sharpened by forty hours abstinence   that i was on an island completely cut off on all sides by water troubled me not at all  i was much too hungry to worry about that  for i felt sure that i could jump back on to my oak bough  which formed a bridge to bring me back to land again  and so i worked steadily downwards from branch to branch   i was only a foot or two from the ground when a rustle among the thick  mossy stumps below attracted my attention  glancing down  the sight that met my eyes almost paralysed me with horror      chapter xi  my last adventure   the animal which had just pushed its way out of the hollow recesses of the hazel roots resembled nothing so much as a weasel  but a weasel of such giant proportions as i had never before dreamed of  from nose to tip of tail it was nearly two feet long  the creature had a domed head  with prominent eyes and widely arched eyebrows  giving it a strangely sinister appearance  it was  in fact  though i did not realize this at the time  no other than the rare and dreaded polecat  which keepers call the foumart   when i first caught sight of this monster i was sitting on a bough barely a couple of feet from the ground  and so great was my amazement and fright that for an instant i sat staring down into the glaring yellow eyes  unable to collect my senses at all  of a sudden the creature launched itself upwards with almost the quickness and ferocity of a striking snake  its thin lips  curled back  showed two rows of close set white teeth  sharp as needles  and at the same instant an abominable odour  like that of a stoat  but far more fœtid  nearly suffocated me   recovering myself just in time  i made one desperate spring  and succeeded in reaching a twig out of reach of the brute s jaws  but the foumart had no idea of being so easily cheated of his meal  the branches  thick and close set  offered him an easy ladder  and to my horror and alarm  he came after me with unexpected and startling speed  i completely lost my head  and dashed away up to the top of the hazel bush with a recklessness inspired by terror   in my haste i found that i had ascended  not the main stalk of the clump  but another not so tall  the result was that the oak branch from which i had dropped was now a long way above me  but a rustle in the foliage below told me that my enemy was at my heels  and nerved me to attempt the jump   my claws just grazed the under side of the oak bough  i fell back  and next moment had plunged with a splash into the swirling waters of the swollen torrent   the fall carried me far below the muddy surface  but next moment i rose  gasping for breath  and struck out vehemently  i know that it is popularly supposed that a squirrel cannot swim  but that when he wishes to cross a river he launches himself upon a piece of floating bark  and using his tail as a sail  ferries himself across  a squirrel  as a matter of fact  is a very fair swimmer  and can  and does at a pinch  cross wide rivers in this way  though i had never tried it before  yet i found myself quite able to keep my head above water  but a very short struggle convinced me that it was foolishness to attempt to make head against the fierce current of the flooded stream   for i had fallen not into the placid backwater behind the nut bush island  but out into the edge of the main stream  and a cross current catching me  had sent me swinging out into the very centre of the racing river  for a few moments i beat the water desperately with all four paws in a frantic effort to get back to the shore which i had left  but very soon i exhausted myself so completely that i could fight no longer  and  paddling feebly  was swept down stream at a positively terrifying speed   it was now late in october  and the water was very cold  soon i began to feel quite numbed  besides this  i was horribly frightened  while the pace at which the small whirlpools into which i was constantly flung  spun me around  made me giddy  and added to the hopelessness of my feelings  the whole experience was so horrifying that i may be forgiven for confessing the terror i felt  once or twice i saw tree roots or projecting points of high banks forming promontories which extended out into the flood  and so long as strength lasted i made fierce efforts to reach them  but in each case the current  rendered the more irresistible by opposition  mocked my puny efforts and whirled me away out into the centre again  once a small log  floating almost submerged  overtook me as i battled with the stream  and  catching me across the neck  pushed me quite under water and drove over me  when i rose once more  my strength was almost spent  and i felt that i could not much longer continue the useless struggle   i was sinking lower and lower in the water  my strokes were becoming more feeble every moment  and it was only a question of a few minutes before i must have sunk for good  when i suddenly caught sight of a long narrow plank  evidently torn from some paling by the flood  sweeping down  end on  beside me  with a last despairing effort i struck out for it  and just before it had passed quite out of my reach  succeeded in scrambling upon one end of it  it dipped beneath my water logged weight  and the current almost snatched me away  but  clinging with all my claws  i managed to crawl along to its centre  and found to my joy that it would support me   but  even so  my position was extremely perilous  the way in which the banks flew by showed how rapid was the rush of the flooded river  suppose the plank caught against any obstacle  it must at once roll over and plunge me again into the water  happily  however  this did not happen  and though time and again it checked and quivered  i managed to retain my hold  and so was swept along almost as fast as a man could run   i passed the large house down the valley  and beyond it the river broadened  but still ran with almost unabated speed  soon i had cleared the wood  and was driving along between pastures which sloped steeply upwards from bluff like banks  once i saw a drowned sheep caught in the brambles under a curve  and shuddered to think how soon the same fate might befall me  field after field flew by  and once more the river plunged into the shadow of thick trees  and then a new and terrifying sound came to my ears  it was the deep  sullen roar of falling water   sweeping round a wide curve  i became aware of a long weir in front penning the brimming river which foamed along its top  while through the open sluice gates the main stream plunged in a mass of yellow foam  now  indeed  i gave myself up for lost  for i saw that i could not hope to survive the passage down that fierce fall  on like an arrow sped the plank  straight for the centre of the opening  and all hope that it might drift against the weir was gone  when  suddenly  with a jar that almost flung me from my insecure perch  the front end of the plank struck something hidden below the muddy water  probably a sunken stake  and instantly was swung side on  jamming across the very mouth of the gates  gathering all my few remaining energies  i made a feeble leap  and more by good luck than good management reached the top of the weir  even then my troubles were not over  for the weir was old and broken  and in places the flood was actually foaming over its top  but after waiting a little to recover my strength  i succeeded in jumping these gaps  and at last struggled safely ashore once more   i was soaked as i had never been in my life before  chilled to the bone  so exhausted that i could hardly move  and yet intensely grateful to be once more on firm ground  luckily for me  the sun was still shining  and the air mild and warm for the time of year  so i crawled up into a small tree  and lying out on a branch on the sunny side  waited for my dripping fur to dry a little   my position was far from an enviable one  here i was  in a strange wood  far away from our winter quarters  and separated from walnut  without food  friends  or a home  however  walnut was luckily well able to look after himself  and there was no doubt about finding food of some sort  so i consoled myself with the thought that i would start as soon as possible and make my way back to the river wood   while i sat there sunning myself i was surprised and pleased to hear a familiar gnawing sound in a neighbouring beech tree  and suddenly there came into view another squirrel  a handsome fellow with an uncommonly light coat  i called to him  and he came across in a most friendly way   he remarked on my dripping coat civilly  and i told him the story of my misfortunes   ‘ugh   he shuddered  with a glance at the foaming river  ‘i wouldn t take a swim in that—not for a coppice full of cob nuts    we chatted for a while  and my new friend was good enough to show me a nice lot of fir cones  on which i made a much needed meal  then i told him that i meant to go back up stream to the river wood  and i suppose i must have dilated on its attractiveness  for suddenly he proposed accompanying me   ‘like you   he said sadly  ‘i have lost my wife and all my family  i don t know what became of them  i was out one day feeding  and when i came home they were all gone  there were footsteps below the tree  so no doubt i have some ruffianly man to thank for stealing them    i was anxious to start at once  but the pale squirrel  who told me that his name was crab  begged me to share his quarters for the night and put off my departure till the morning  oddly enough  though very tired  i was singularly unwilling to defer my start  however  he over persuaded me  and for him the delay proved sad indeed  though fortunate enough for me   crab s quarters were in a very odd place—in the hollow head of a large pollard willow not far from the water s edge  i told him that i had never before seen a squirrel live in a willow  and he explained that he had adopted this refuge because the ground beneath was so wet and swampy that it choked off human intruders  by degrees i found out that this wood was simply at the mercy of tramps and other vagabonds who camped there in numbers  crab showed me the ashes of their fires alongside of the rough cart track which ran through the coppice  and the places where they had cut wood to burn  evidently here was the other extreme from the hall grounds—a country utterly neglected by its owners  not a rabbit was to be seen  and crab told me that  except for wood pigeons and small birds  there was hardly a living thing in the wood   ‘the gipsies even catch the hedgehogs  roast them in clay  and eat them   he said with a shudder   ‘and who are gipsies   i inquired  puzzled  i had never heard the word before   crab shuddered   ‘brown men with traps and snares  and black haired women with red handkerchiefs and shining earrings  terrible people  cleverer than keepers  and much more greedy  pray you may not see any   he ended   what crab told me made me the more anxious to clear out of this ill omened spot  and next morning  as soon as the dew was a little off the grass  we started  crab did not know much about the way we had to travel  but the river was our guide  what we both were chiefly afraid of were open meadows over which we knew that we had to pass  however  i was by now such a hardened wanderer that the risks of such a journey did not trouble me greatly   it was an ideal autumn morning  calm  with a warm sun shining out of a blue sky  and the rain washed air marvellously clear  small birds chirped and twittered in every hedge  but i could see for myself that what crab had told me was true  there was no game left in the whole country side  even rabbits were very scarce  the fields  too  were neglected  they were not half drained  so that the grass was rough  and patchy with clumps of reeds  the hedges were untrimmed  immensely high  and yet full of gaps  the lane running parallel with the river was scored with deep ruts which brimmed with muddy puddles   the tall hedges offered us excellent travelling  and we saw nobody except a couple of farm labourers striding along through the mud  their corduroy trousers tied below their knees with string  and their short clay pipes leaving a trail of strong smelling blue smoke in their wake   for half a mile or so we kept the hedge alongside the lane  then the road turned abruptly away from the river  so we left it  crossed a meadow  and got into another hedge which seemed to lead us in the right direction  it brought us after a time into a large leasowe sloping to the river  this leasowe i remember as one of the most beautiful places which i have ever seen  the ground  dropping sharply  was thickly studded with clumps of alder and hazel  the tops of which had been cut at irregular interval  while the roots had grown to enormous dimensions  each clump was surrounded by a tangle of blackberry and brier  making a thick  impenetrable shelter  the leaves of these various trees were all in the full splendour of late autumn tints  and contrasted brilliantly with the green of the grass and the myriads of scarlet hips and haws  while there were dotted about the leasowe a number of crab apple trees whose scarlet leaves and red and golden fruit gave a last touch of gorgeous colouring to the whole scene   there were a good many nuts  and we crossed leisurely from clump to clump  now stopping to shell a nut  now to sample the crimson side of a crab apple  i was tasting some over ripe blackberries  many of which contained the most delicious little white grubs  when crab suggested that it was time to push on  as we still had a long way to go  and the shadows were almost at their shortest   between us and the far hedge was a widish interval of fairly open grass  bounded on the upper side by a regular thicket of hazel  as we crossed this open space crab suddenly drew my attention to a very odd looking erection which stood in a sort of bay in the hazel brush  i had never seen anything quite like it before  and  our curiosity thoroughly aroused  we moved slowly and cautiously towards it   ‘ pon my claws  i believe it s a pheasant coop   i said at last   ‘there are no pheasants here   replied crab  ‘besides  it s got no sides    no more it had  i saw that plainly as we approached it more closely  it appeared to be a sort of sloping roof made of pieces of rough planking  and propped above a hole in the ground   suddenly crab stopped short  ‘what s this   he exclaimed  i did not wait to explain  a delicious morsel of white bread lay before me  and i fell upon it and gobbled it up promptly  it was more than a year since i had tasted such a luxury   ‘is it good   inquired crab curiously   ‘bet your back teeth it is   i said   ‘why  here s another piece  i ll try it   exclaimed my friend  he did so  and approved greatly  i found a third  and presently we were racing in short dashes up the queer looking erection to which a trail of bread led directly   inside the dug out hollow below the sloping roof the ground was white with crumbs   ‘crab   i said  after a good stare at the whole thing  ‘i don t quite like the look of it    ‘why  what s the matter    ‘i don t know   i answered  ‘all i can say is  i don t like it  i wouldn t go under the roof if i were you    ‘nonsense  why should i chuck away the chance of a feed like this    before i could object again he had jumped down and was busily engaged with the bread  my mouth watered  i could see no sign of danger  there was nothing to suggest a trap  why should not i also enjoy the delicacies  i was on the very verge of following crab s example  another second and i should have been alongside of him  when suddenly  and without the slightest warning  thump  down came the wooden roof  and crab was a prisoner beneath it  at the same instant there was a crash among the hazel bushes  a sharp yelp  and a brown faced  bare legged boy  accompanied by a large mongrel  dashed down upon me   i was off like a flash  and by a desperate effort gained the nearest tree—an ancient pollard oak—which stood quite by itself at some distance both from the hedge and the hazel bushes  the dog bounded high against the rough trunk  but i was safely out of his reach  and  curling myself into the smallest possible compass  crouched in the gnarled top of the club like head of the tree   ‘watch him  tige   shouted the boy  and the dog at once crouched silently at the foot of the tree  while his master walked to the trap  from my elevated position i could watch it all  and  what was more  see plainly an old sand pit behind the hazel bushes  with a tent at the bottom of it  two children playing outside  and a couple of ponies grazing near by   wrapping his hand in his cap  the boy cautiously seized hold of my poor friend  i  of course  supposed that he meant to make a captive of him  but  to my horror  the young fiend wrung the unhappy crab s neck  and marched off with him back to the camp   ‘wot you got  zeke   came a gruff voice from the tent  ‘a partridge    ‘ tain t no partridge   tis a squir l   e ll ait fine    i saw the elder ruffian seize poor crab s dead body  and then  ‘pity us ain t got another   he said  ‘two on  em  ud mek a nutty stew    ‘there s another atop o  oak—tree  tige s watchin  un    ‘get un down   was the father s order   ‘you ll  ave to come an   elp me   said the boy  ‘ tis too  igh for me to climb    ‘mother  you skin this un   called the elder man   a sallow faced woman took crab s body from him  and then he and his son came up out of the pit towards the oak    illustration  the dog bounded high  but i was safely out of his reach    i gave myself up for lost  remember  the tree was a pollard  and  having been lopped not more than four or five years before  its branches were thin and straight  they provided no cover at all  the crown from which they sprung was not more than twenty feet above the ground  once my enemies climbed it  there was no escape  for if i ran out to the end of a branch and dropped i should undoubtedly fall into the yawning jaws of tige the dog  but the instinct of self preservation is strong  casting round me desperately  i saw a small crevice in the knotted trunk top  at first it seemed far too small to hold me  but somehow or other i forced myself through  though i scored my sides as i did so  my claws met no foothold  i made a grasp at thin air  and fell flop half a dozen feet  landing upon a bed of soft  rotten wood  when my eyes became accustomed to the gloom  i saw that the trunk was completely hollow for a man s height from the top  it was not quite dark  for the daylight leaked through various small crevices  but there was no hole large enough for a man to put his hand through   the scraping of boots on the rough outside bark jarred the whole hollow trunk  presently i heard a voice from below  ‘where be  e  zeke    ‘can t see un  vather   cried the boy  who was by the sound on the crown of the oak   ‘that vool tige s let  im go    ‘i ll lay  e ain t   piped the boy   ‘where be  e  then    silence and more groping up above  i began to hope that the hole through which i had passed might escape the sharp eyes of the boy   no such luck   ‘ e s down inside  vather   ere be th   ole    ‘put thy  and down an  pull un out    the light was cut off from above   ‘her s all  ollow inside   cried the boy  ‘i can t reach un    ‘cut a stick an  put un through    a pause  and presently a long bough came poking down  which i easily avoided  but—worse luck —the boy s quick ears heard me moving   ‘he s here  vather  i heard un  tell ee what  us ll smoke un out    memory flashed back to the poachers and the suffocated pheasants  now  indeed  i was lost  in helpless terror i heard them piling leaves and twigs below the tree  and then the click of a striking match   blue fumes began to eddy through a knot hole  but the bed of rotten wood below me was so thick and damp that they passed over my head and i was still able to breathe   i heard the man swearing  and then he called to his boy   ‘zeke  fetch t  chopper  us  ll have to cut un out    soon there came a pounding on the outside of the trunk which reverberated through the hollow  jarring me horribly  the outer crust was of no great thickness  and could not resist their blows for very long   rotten wood  bits of rubbish of all kinds began to rain down upon me through the smoke which still hung about the hollow interior of the tree  thinking any fate better than dying like a rat in a trap  i climbed back up the wall of my refuge in an attempt to reach the knot hole again  half suffocated and completely dazed  i did manage to struggle up to it  got my paws on either side and tried to force my way through  alas  a splinter broke away from the rough wood at the edge of the hole  and pinned me helplessly  i could get neither forward nor back   fate was too strong for me  i gave up all hope  and ceased to struggle  in another minute at most the boy would find me  and i should share poor crab s fate  i heard a crash as the chopper broke through the bark below  and zeke s voice   ‘vather   e be up top again    then it seemed to me that a miracle happened  instead of the old fellow s voice  the crisp  curt tones that cut the air were those of my one time master  jack   ‘hi  you fellows  what are you about    down dropped zeke  there followed a crash among the bushes  a short interval  would jack find me  i struggled again furiously  but in vain  the splinter held me tight  and the only result of my efforts was exquisite pain   ‘i wonder what those gipsy chaps were after   came jack s voice  ‘i d better have a look    fresh sounds of scrambling  and all of a sudden my master s face over the edge of the gnarled oak crown   ‘why  it s a squirrel    summoning all my remaining energies i gave a pitiful choked squeak  a feeble attempt at the cry i used to call him with in the long gone days at the hall   ‘what  no  it can t be  it s absurd  and yet —jack s voice rose to a shout—‘by jove   it is nipper    i felt his hand round me  his touch as gentle as ever  ‘you poor little chap  how did you come here  and stuck tight  too  never mind  poor old nipper boy  i ll get you out all right  just wait a jiffy    out came his knife  and with the utmost gentleness he cut the wood away all round  in another minute i was free  and safe in his hand   ‘what  hurt  old chap  i must get it out   with wonderful tenderness and deftness he pulled out the sharp splinter  ‘there  it s not much  only a skin wound  how in the name of all that s wonderful  did you come here  half a county away from the hall    as he spoke he slipped me into the pocket of his norfolk jacket and dropped quickly out of the tree   when he took me out again we were in the terraced garden of the house which i had seen by the river  jack ran up the drive and burst into the house  shouting at the top of his voice   ‘harry  where are you    next minute out ran his brother   if ever i longed to be able to talk man talk  then was the time  how astonished they all were  for mabel and mrs  fortescue soon joined the boys  and were full of the same amazement at what they considered my strange and mysterious reappearance  i always wonder if they knew how much stranger i thought it at the time   and yet it was simple enough  the house belonged to mrs  fortescue s brother  a wealthy bachelor whose hobby it was to travel all over the world  it was he who had brought lops  the flying squirrel  home from mexico  and joey  the cockatoo  from west africa  he had lent the fortescues his house  and there they were living  and there jack had joined them for one of his brief holidays   as my old master took me up to his room that night  ‘old chap   he said  ‘you and i are not going to part any more  even if i have to take you back to london town    no more we have  he did take me back to london  but it was only for a few weeks  for the fortescues came into some money unexpectedly   that is two years ago  now we are back at the dear old hall  the new tenant with his band box son  his ginger whiskered
